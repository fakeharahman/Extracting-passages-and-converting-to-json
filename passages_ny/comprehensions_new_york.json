        "passage": "It was late in December, the last busy days of the year. But the seven or eight boys\non the windy beach were as lighthearted and free as ever. The eldest was twelve, the\nyoungest nine. They were gathered beneath a dune in lively discussion. Some were\nstanding. Others sat. One rested his chin in his hands, elbows dug deep in the sand. As they\ntalked, the sun went down in the west.\nTheir talking now over, the boys galloped off along the water’s edge. From inlet to inlet\neach ran as he pleased. The group was quickly dispersed. One by one they retrieved what\nthe storm had brought two nights before and the ebb tide had left behind: rotted boards, a\nchipped bowl, bamboo slivers, chunks of wood, an old ladle with the handle torn off. The\nboys heaped them up on a dry patch of sand away from the lapping waves. All that they\ngathered was soaking wet. …\nThe spoils of their hunt they had gathered for burning. With the red flames, wild joy\nwould be theirs. Running and leaping across, they would prove their courage. And now\nfrom the dunes they gathered dry grass. The eldest stepped forward and touched it with\nfire. They stood in a circle and waited to hear the crack of bamboo split by the flames. But\nonly the grass burned. It caught and died, caught and died. A few puffs of smoke floated\nup, nothing more. The wood, the bamboo were untouched. The mirror frame only was\ncharred here and there. With a weird hiss, steam shot out from the end of the pole. One\nafter another the boys dropped to the sand and blew at the pile as hard as they could. But\ninstead of flames, smoke arose, stinging their eyes. Their cheeks were stained with tears. …\nLook, look, one boy shouted, the Izu hill fires! If their fires burn, then why shouldn’t\nours? All leaped to their feet, looking out towards the water. Far across the great Bay of\nSagami two fires flickered and trembled, so feeble they might be just will-o’-the-wisps. Now\nthat harvest is over, the farmers of Izu must be burning the chaff of their fields in the hills.\nSurely these are the fires that bring tears to the eyes of winter travellers. Their distant\nbeams tell only of the long, dark road ahead.\nThe boys danced wildly and clapped and sang, The hills are burning, the hills are\nburning. Their innocent voices rang through the dusk, down the long, lonely beach. The\nwhispering of the waves blended with their voices. The waves rushed in from the southern\ntip of the inlet in foaming white lines. The tide was beginning to rise. …\nStill vexed by their failure, the eldest boy looked back at the pile as he ran. One more\ntime he looked back from the top of the dune before running down the far side. It has\ncaught, he shouted, Our fire has caught, when he saw the flames on the beach. The others,\namazed, climbed back to the top. They stood in a row and looked down.\nIt was true. The stubborn bits of wood, fanned by the wind, had caught fire. Smoke\nbillowed up and red tongues of flame shot out, disappeared and shot out again. The sharp\ncrack of bamboo joints splitting in the fire, the shower of sparks with each report.1 Indeed,\nthe fire had caught. But the boys stood their ground, clapped and shouted with joy, then\nturned and raced down the hill for home.\nNow the ocean was dark and from the beach, too, the sun was gone. All that was left\nwas the winter night’s loneliness. And on the desolate beach the fire burned, alone,\nuntended. …",

        "passage": "Handcycling was developed in the 1980s by people working to create alternate types of\nhuman-powered vehicles. So it was almost by accident that a new world of cycling was\nopened to people with disabilities. …\n“The disabled community picked up on it right away,” said Ian Lawless, Colorado\nregional director and cycling director for Adaptive Adventures. Even people with one\nworking arm can handcycle with some modifications made to the equipment, said Lawless.\n“Just about anyone can do it. It’s an accessible sport. It’s not just for racing; it’s also for\nrecreational riding. It’s a barrier breaker that allows a disabled rider to participate in cycling\nwith friends and families who may be riding conventional bicycles.”\nIn the 25 years since its development, handcycling has continued to grow in popularity.\nIt’s been part of the IPC [International Paralympic Committee] cycling program since 1998,\nand the 2004 Paralympics included handcycling racing for the first time. Today, thousands\nof people, able-bodied and those with disabilities, have turned to handcycling as a means to\nimprove their cardiovascular health, increase upper-body strength, compete, and ride with\nfriends and family. …\nAn upright handcycle is an entry-level bike for those who are new to the sport, who just\nwant exercise or recreation, or who don’t want to ride very long distances or go very fast.\nBecause of their higher center of gravity, upright handcycles aren’t suitable for speeds\nhigher than 15 mph. The internal gear systems, borrowed from the cycling industry,\nusually come in a choice of three or seven speeds, which naturally limits the speed to less\nthan 15 mph. They are easy to transfer in and out of from a wheelchair, and have a natural,\nfork-type steering system.\nRecumbent1 handcycles come in a few different variations. There are two steering\noptions: fork-steer and lean-to-steer, and two seating options: one where the rider reclines\nand the other, a “trunk-power” version, where the rider leans forward. They usually come\nwith 27-gear drivetrains,2 although they can be purchased with three- or seven-gear\ndrivetrains.\nThe trunk-power handcycle doesn’t have much of a seatback. The cranks are low to the\nground and far away from the rider. With this arrangement, riders are able to put the weight\nof their trunks behind each stroke, allowing them to go faster for longer. The limitation to\nthis type of handcycle, Lawless said, is that the athlete must have control of most or all of\nhis abdominal muscles, so it may not be suitable for all athletes.\nWith the other seating option, the rider sits in a seat with a reclined back. The cranks\nare higher and closer, allowing the rider to use the seatback for leverage to rotate the\ncranks. …\nThe lean-to-steer version has a two-piece frame where the top frame swivels over the\nbottom frame. The front wheel turns along with the seat. The rider initiates the turn by\nleaning his whole body. There is a bit of a learning curve with this type, but many riders\nprefer this type because they have a feel similar to monoskiing.3 They’re used primarily, but\nnot exclusively, by people with lower-level disabilities. Lawless said there’s no advantage of\none type of steering over the other. It’s primarily a matter of the athlete’s preference. …",

We pack and\npack—eighty boxes already, and so far, with two weeks still to go, we haven’t missed a thing.\nWhat do we keep it all for? Books and more books; unused wedding presents and\nmismatched wine glasses; worn-out stuffed animals and outgrown toys; sheaves of letters;\nboxes of loose photographs; a landfill of sweaters, shoes, and clothes: the weighty\napparatus of four lives. It will take more than two hundred book boxes, dish barrels, mirror\nboxes, mattress crates, a football field of paper, bubble wrap, and tape to contain it all. We\nwant to contain it. We want to hold it tight. …\nThere’s no place like home, Dorothy chants, clicking her ruby heels as she recites her\ndream-dissolving spell. I’ve moved half a dozen times since I first left my parents’ house for\ncollege, twenty-five years ago this fall, and sometimes I wonder if there is any place I’ll ever\nreally feel at home. I feel loose-footed on this spinning planet, as displaced as those\nmountains vanished in the fog. Of course, you don’t have to move physically to leave\nyourself behind. Something is lost with every tick of the second hand on the clock. …\nMy parents still live in the house in which I grew up, and my childhood room remains\nalmost exactly the way I left it when I last lived there at eighteen. It’s a shrine to my\nlong-vanished child-self, a garden gone to seed, a tangle of dusty paperbacks, knickknacks,\nand disheveled dolls. My mother refuses to throw anything away, although lately she’s been\nurging me to come and weed things out myself.\n“I don’t want to leave you with a mess to clean up when I die,” she says. Now that we’re\nmoving, she says, it’s time.\nBack in Boston for a visit, I shake open a large black trash bag and sit down on the floor\nof my old room. From a built-in cabinet, I exhume a postcard of Baryshnikov in midleap, a\nsilver-plated pendant in the shape of a Hershey’s Kiss, faded mimeographs of high school\nclass songs and summer reading lists, stacks of letters, a flowered fabric-covered scrapbook\n(blank). I remember each of these objects perfectly, though I haven’t thought of them in\nyears. I take a breath, open the trash bag, and stuff them in.\nMy mother comes in and perches on the edge of the bed. “You don’t need to throw\neverything away, you know,” she says, reaching for a postcard with a cartoon of a girl with\ngoogly eyes on the front and my long-dead paternal grandmother’s spidery handwriting on\nthe back. My most beloved darling. It’s dated August 1970. I would have been seven then,\nthe same age as my daughter now. Will we be sitting together like this, looking at postcards\nfrom my own mother, when my daughter is forty-three?\nMy mother says, “You know, you only need to get rid of those things you don’t want to\nkeep.”\nWhat don’t I want? I fish the pendant out of the trash bag, fingering the Kiss’s paper\npull-tab, which reads “I Love You,” and which, amazingly, is still in tact. I give it to my\ndaughter, along with the scrapbook and a doll with floozy blond hair and tattered clothes, \nand pack them all into yet another box to be shipped to our new Ohio home. I retrieve the\nletters, the postcards, the mimeographs; I open the cabinet and put them back.\nTo my surprise my mother is satisfied with this. In fact she seems relieved. “Everything\nwill be here for you whenever you want it,” she says. …",

        "passage": "…Inspired by another successful eradication [of malaria] in Sardinia, in 1955 the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) inaugurated what was then the most ambitious campaign\nagainst disease in history, the Global Malaria Eradication Programme. The program\nincluded spraying home interiors with insecticides and distributing antimalarial drugs to\npeople in affected regions. But WHO’s efforts yielded only partial success. The disease did\ndisappear in Europe, Russia, Australia and most of the Caribbean. South Asia initially saw\ndramatic reductions of infections, but the disease soon bounced back. Other hotspots fared\neven worse.\nWhat went wrong? In a word, everything. The parasites fought back, becoming\nresistant to common medications. The mosquitoes grew stronger too, as more and more of\nthem were able to survive insecticides. In some climates, mosquitoes bred so quickly that\ninsecticide applications simply couldn’t keep up. All the while, local tribes were waging wars\nof their own, which bogged down already-inadequate health infrastructures1 and made public\nhealth interventions difficult and dangerous. In 1969, WHO shut down its program.\nNational malaria-control programs followed, but they later fell into neglect or were\nabandoned entirely. …\nSpraying insecticides isn’t the only way to use them. Mosquito-repellent bed nets2\ntreated with a class of insecticides called pyrethroids, which bind more easily to nets than\nDDT,3 cost just $1 to $2 apiece in Africa. And nets give some major bang for their buck: A\nstudy published last year found that a 10-fold increase in nets resulted in 44 percent fewer\ndeaths among Kenyan children in the studied areas. In September of 2006, Kenya’s\ngovernment used a $17-million Global Fund grant to provide 3.4 million\ninsecticide-treated nets to children. Zambia followed its lead. In 2006, 23 percent of\nZambian children slept under treated nets, up from 1 percent in 2000. …\nIn the face of widespread drug resistance, scientists have turned to a flowering shrub\ncalled wormwood (Artemisia annua), the active ingredient of which, artemisinin, has potent\nanti-fever properties. Since 2004, when WHO began promoting the use of artemisinin\nworldwide, the drug has proved to be extremely fast-acting and effective against\nP. falciparum.\n4 WHO now recommends it or its derivatives as the first line of defense\nagainst the parasite in areas where chloroquine5 no longer works, such as much of\nsub-Saharan Africa. Artemisinin is now one of the most powerful tools against malaria. …\nFortunately, powerful synthetic versions of the drug are on the horizon. Since 2000,\npharmaceutical scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center have been working\non an entirely synthetic antimalarial designed to mimic artemisinin. In preclinical lab tests,\nthe drug, called OZ277, was found to be even more effective than artemisinin derivatives.\nThe medication is currently in the last stage of clinical trials and, although a price for the\ndrug has not been determined, it will probably be less expensive than artemisinin. …\nComplete eradication of malaria on the scale of polio will never be achieved without a\nvaccine. Creating that magic bullet, however, has been a tremendous challenge. Obstacles\ninclude the complexity of the parasites and their ability to quickly change and adapt. We\nalso don’t completely understand our bodies’ immune response to them. But a vaccine is\nfinally on the horizon. Over the past 25 years, the pharmaceutical company\nGlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has spent $300 million developing a malaria vaccine against\nP. falciparum. RTS,S, as it’s called, helps the immune system fight off the parasites by \nblocking their ability to reproduce and develop in the liver, where they first arrive and\nmultiply. With grants from the Gates Foundation and other groups, the company recently\ntested RTS,S on humans. Last October [2007], the vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of\nmalarial infection by 65 percent among infants in Mozambique—a huge victory. …",

It’s hard to imagine I rage against the\ndust bunnies and grit on my hardwood floor, when here in Yosemite’s backcountry I sleep\non dirt, stir it into my oatmeal and shake it from my boots. My hair, skin and clothes\nthicken with grime each day. Filthy and blistered, I am happier than I have felt in years.\nPerhaps it is the constant exertion that makes me so patient, content. After hauling a\npack stuffed with six days of food and gear up mountain passes, down steep ravines, and\nacross meadows, I find myself at sunset, hungry and worn to bliss. It’s far from the exhaustion I feel after a grueling day teaching, paying bills, and cooking. No, this is purely\nphysical. My body aches for sleep, but my mind is as clear as the dusk light on Vogelsang\nLake. In this new place, I feel I’ve come home.\nAt the first light of dawn, I awake to scurry up rocks to watch the sunrise spread soft\npinks, then fiery yellow across the slate sky. In the meadow below me, two deer perk up\ntheir heads to scrutinize a sound on the wind. They begin running and I scan the fields\nexpecting to see a bear, wolf, or other reason for their flight. Seeing no animal, I wonder if\nthey’re just running to run, something I rarely do. At home, I’m so busy trying to keep up\nwith my own expectations I’m always running towards something or from something. Here\nin Yosemite, there is no such pull. Clutched in the palm of these granite cathedrals, I’m in\nawe, a lithe1 lupine2 warming to the sun.\nPerhaps this is why dirt in the wilderness never bothers me. I don’t need to control it or\nmop it away. It’s not my dirt or my husband’s dirt to clean, but the soil for ponderosas,\nsequoias and tufts of mountain grass. It belongs here—crunching beneath my boots, lining\nvalleys between glacial peaks. Yosemite’s dirt doesn’t hover behind windows or wait in\npainted corners to be swept into a plastic bag. It is the ground beneath me.\nI pick up a handful of pine needle-saturated soil and imagine hurling it across my living\nroom rug. How much dirt would it take to make my house a home? Could I carry this same\nmountain peace back to my rectangular plot of driveway and lawn cut into a grid of streets?\nSifting soil through my fingers, I’m suddenly confused by the shiny black and white\nlinoleum we installed in our kitchen floor. How did I get so far from this place?\nI’ve spent too many years identifying comfort with the mattress on my bed and the\nwater pressure in my shower. Comfort is also this moment sitting with my butt numb from\ncold granite, my legs sunburned and caked in dust, my feet blistered and sweating in wool\nsocks. I wonder how I can remember this luxury when I return home to my terry cloth\nrobe? Is sanity ever possible within four walls, or will I always hover like dust in window\nsunbeams, restless to be outside again?",

        "passage": "Sure, you know their names, possibly better than you know the name of the street you\nlive on—almost every writer does. When the need comes, these names drip lightly and\nquickly off our tongues like they were our own brothers. I am thinking about the famed\neponymous1 duo Webster’s Dictionary and Roget’s Thesaurus.\nBut I dare say, almost none of us can identify the actual person or conjure up anything\nabout him. Don’t report me, but neither did I until I started to write this column.\nWebster’s Dictionary. Many people can respond immediately: Noah Webster. We are\naware that he is the father of the dictionary. But who was he? What did he do for a living?\nWhen did he live?\nNoah was born in 1758, graduated from Yale University in 1778, and subsequently\ngraduated from law school. He produced the first American dictionary in 1806 and\npublished his sentinel work An American Dictionary of the English Language in 1828. His\ninterests led him to be a lexicographer,2 textbook editor, author, Bible translator and spelling\nreformer. He campaigned for years to secure nationwide copyright privileges for authors,\nand he succeeded in 1790. His ubiquitous3 mind produced extensive writings in epidemic\ndiseases, mythology, meteors, and the relationship of European and Asian languages. In\naddition, he founded the first New York daily newspaper. He died in 1843.\nAnother dictionary eponym almost as well-known is Merriam-Webster Dictionary. So\nwe have to ask, “Where did Merriam come from? What relationship does Merriam have to\nWebster?”\nGeorge and Charles Merriam purchased the right to revise Webster’s dictionary after\nhis death in 1843. They produced several revised and expanded editions, and the\n“Collegiate” series was begun in 1898. The C. and G. Merriam Company eventually lost its\nexclusive right to the Webster name and in 1983, the company name changed to MerriamWebster, Inc. with the publication of Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. The\nC. and G. Merriam Company has been owned by Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. since 1964.\nThat brings us to…\nRoget’s Thesaurus. And it gives us the chance to learn about Roget, the man—\nPeter Mark Roget. Who? What? When?\nEnglishman Peter Roget, MD, was born in 1779. He studied medicine and mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, entering at age 14 and graduating at age 19. He is\nacclaimed as the creator of the first-ever thesaurus, a compilation of words and phrases\naccording to meaning rather than alphabetic order. It has been called one of the 3 most\nimportant books ever printed, along with the Bible and Webster’s dictionary.\nHe began his monumental work Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases in 1805 but\ndid not release it publicly until 1852 — 47 years later. Meanwhile, he was earning a deserved\nreputation as a distinguished physician and anatomist.\nIn his lifetime, he became a noted lecturer and writer on anatomy, sewer sanitation,\nmagnetism, bees, geology, and more. He wrote a landmark paper, “Persistence of Vision\nwith Regard to Moving Objects,” which stirred much research and dispute in the scientific\nand optics community.\nWhen Roget died in 1869 at age 90, his son, John, took over the Thesaurus and he\ngradually expanded it.\n[Physician and writer—what an interesting combination!]\nSo now you know these men—the “-nyms”4 in the eponyms. Not enough information?\nAs James Thurber suggested in the title of his 1941 book about baseball, You Could Look\nIt Up!",

        "passage": "That night, Susan and I stood on the banks of the river, which was moving blackly with\nits load of white ice floes.1 The floes were flat on the top and big as the floor of my cabin.\nSome were as big as a river barge. They all moved downstream in a ghostly procession,\nseparated by jagged black lines where the water was bare. The edges crunched when they\ntouched and hissed when they swept by. In the center of the river, where the current ran\nswifter, a band of floes moved much more quickly than those near the sides.\nThe moon was full, which would make the footing easier for Susan, for she must jump\nfrom floe to floe to cross the river. We stood alone—hand in hand at the edge of water, our\nskin separated by the wool of our mittens. No other eyes, no other soul, would watch her\ngo. Silence, stillness, cold. They chimed about us as one snowy chord. …\nWhen I saw Susan step upon the ice, I bit my lower lip till the blood flowed down my\nchin and crusted in the cold. Here the riverbank was no higher than a step, as from house\nto yard. In the moonlight, new snow like sugar glittered atop the sheet of ice lying along the\nbank. Behind her, in a lengthening path, Susan’s footprints indented the sparkling snow. She\nmoved toward the center of the river as calmly as though crossing a broad\nmoonlit road cut through the brush and trees of the wilderness.\nWhen she came to the first black edge, she stepped across the open water as though it\nwere a mere stream. The next floe was smaller, and the next even smaller; they dipped or\ntilted slightly when she stepped onto them. The spans of open water between them seemed\nwider and wider, and sometimes she waited for the current to bring the ice rafts closer\ntogether. Then she leapt the narrowed fissure and walked on. …\nAs the current accelerated and the spaces between floes widened, Susan ran and\njumped from raft to raft; my heart hung in the air with her. In the center of the river, the\nswifter current zipped the ice rafts downstream, with Susan standing on one of them. Her\narms fluttered once for balance, twice. …\nAt last the treacherous midsection of river was traversed. She was far from me\nnow—a dark upright using the flatness: flying and landing, running and leaping, from floe\nto floe. I saw shapes in the ice rafts, mostly like enormous animals, flat, not like a natural\nswan or bear but flat as a cookie animal or a tin weathervane. Near the other side,\napproaching a bend, she had to wait for her floe to come close to the bank. Holding the\nstitch2 in my side, I continued walking as rapidly downstream as I could till I came to a high\nbut tangled shoreline that thwarted me. Soon the current would sweep Susan’s floe beyond\nmy sight. O, carry her close, carry her close, now, I prayed to the ice, and I prayed that\nSusan would not feel herself passing beyond my sight and take the risk of trying to jump\nashore when the gulf remained too great. The floe that wheeled her toward the far shore\nwas like the palm of a hand, open and presentational.\nPatient Susan! Her ice raft nudged the shore, and she jumped. Even as her shoes\nlanded on the snowy bank, she turned and looked exactly where I stood. Together we\nlifted our arms, blowing each other a kiss across the water, for we had not kissed on \nparting, saving it till she should be safe, and trusting the sweet air to be our go-between.\nAnd then one shout, though it was small from the distance, from Susan: Freedom!",

        "passage": "Lynda LaPlante, 45, just wanted to do something nice for her boyfriend, Roland. So\nwhen she heard that singer John Mayer was performing at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield,\nMassachusetts, she surfed the Internet hoping to buy a pair of tickets. A “Buy Tickets Now”\nWeb link took LaPlante to TheSeats.com, where she nabbed two lawn seats at $60 each,\nplus an additional $15 for shipping and $18 in service fees. Total price: $153.\nToo bad the tickets really cost $24.95 each. Unbeknownst to LaPlante, she had just\nmade a way-overpriced, sorry-no-refunds deal on an Internet ticket site. There are two\ntypes of ticket sellers, on the Web: the first, primary sellers, includes box offices and\nauthorized companies such as Ticketmaster and Tickets.com. The next group is known as\nsecondary sellers. These more risky dot-coms range from ticket brokers—companies that\nscoop up in-demand tickets and resell them for more than face value (using automated\nsoftware and phone banks, resellers can snap up thousands of tickets within minutes of a\nsale)—to marketplace websites such as StubHub, RazorGator, eBay, and Craigslist, where\nindividuals can sell tickets for any price, with almost zero guarantees for the buyer. The\nresult: a Wild West ticket market that’s become anywhere from a $3 billion to $20 billion\nindustry.\nOne of the scalper’s best weapons: deception. Thanks to the Internet, sellers can lure\nbuyers to sites that look official but are actually havens for high-priced tickets. That’s how\nAARP THE MAGAZINE deputy editor Nancy Graham, 51, was duped. While searching the\nInternet for “Wolf Trap”—a performing arts center in Virginia—and “tickets,” she\nmistakenly ended up on GreatSeats.com and bought a pair of orchestra seats to a Doobie\nBrothers concert for $160 each. Face value $40. “I feel like a fool,” she says. …\nPrice, however, isn’t the only problem: all too often buyers of scalped tickets don’t get\nwhat they paid for. Arline Zatz, 69, forked over $200 for two $25 seats she bought while\npersonally visiting a local broker. “I knew they were overpriced and I resented it, but I took\nthem because they were supposedly in a superior location,” she says. Instead, her view was\nblocked by a large television camera. Adding to her irritation: “We saw plenty of empty\nseats.”…\nSome artists are fighting back. In 2006 rock star Tom Petty launched a new fan club to\ngive faithful followers the first shot at the best seats for his summer tour. When ticket\nbrokers and independent scalpers joined the club to buy and then resell premium seats for\nfive times their retail value, Petty’s management and promoters had the last laugh.\nTicketmaster, the official distributor for Petty’s tour, and the various arenas painstakingly\nmatched seat locations listed for sale online with those purchased during the fan-club\npresale—and voided more than 1,400 tickets so they could be resold to true fans. Buyers\nhad to show an ID to pick up their tickets on show night. Petty’s manger, Tony Dimitriades,\ncalls it “a step in the right direction and a major strike on behalf of the good guys.” …\nEven industry giant Ticketmaster is making a stand with its online channel, “Stop the\nScammers” (www.ticketmaster.com/stopthescammers). The site allows consumers to report\nticket fraud and includes links to consumer-protection agencies. …",

        "passage": "The forest stretching out before us covers the mountain slopes with splashes of\nburgundies and yellows. The delicate hues melt into the blue sky like a runny watercolor\npainting. The colors match our expectations for autumn in the mountains, but the scale is\nout of kilter. Instead of towering trees, this forest barely reaches our knees.\nOn the tundra of Alaska’s Denali National Park, the short growing season and long\nwinters stunt willow, birch and alder trees into pigmy forests. The abbreviated spring and\nsummer compresses the wildflower bloom into July, and the fall display of colors into the\nfirst two weeks of September. At high latitudes and high elevations, the seasons rush past\nlike a downhill skier. We can feel winter in the wind.\nWe first see a grizzly and her two cubs on a far ridge eating blueberries. The driver\nstops, and we crowd toward the right side of the shuttle bus. The bear slowly makes her way\nin our direction, the cubs following dutifully. Then one pauses to sniff something. The other\ntakes the opportunity to pounce, and the two roll and wrestle like playful kittens. The\nclicking cameras sound like approaching thunder.\nThe bears disappear in a woody depression. We wait. Suddenly, they reappear a few\nyards in front of the bus and cross the road. The 400-pound mother methodically raises a\nblueberry limb with her powerful claw and delicately nibbles off the ripe fruit while the\nwhimsical cubs entertain us with their antics.\n“I never dreamed we’d see anything this exciting,” one woman whispers. “I expected\nincredible scenery and wildlife, but only at a distance. This is like living with the bears.” …\nThe bears continue feeding and playing, aware but unconcerned about our presence as\nlong as we stay on the bus. Paradoxically, “staying on the bus” is the best, and perhaps the\nonly, relationship humans can have that preserves the wild. We feel a part of nature the\nmost when our presence affects it the least. …\nBy the time we reach Eielson Visitors Center, Denali is socked in. As one of life’s\nironies, something as ephemeral1 as water vapor can completely obscure the most majestic\npeak in North America. The next 30 miles to Kantishna Roadhouse, our overnight lodge,\noffer unobstructed views of Denali, if only the clouds will lift. They tease us with glimpses,\nbut refuse to unmask the face of the mastiff. …\nWe arrive just as streams of the September sun break through low clouds and\nilluminate the tops of the snow-covered peaks. Wisps of clouds hover over Denali like a\nmagician’s cloak, but finally the crest is unveiled. Now I understand why the natives called\nthe mountain “The High One.” The peak looms a mile above its 15,000-foot neighbors.\nThe beauty of the scene transfixes us. As if on cue, a moose wades into the lake to\ncreate the perfect picture. The combination of wildlife and mountains epitomizes2 the\nessence of pristine North America. We’re presented with the gift of wilderness personified. …\nIn Alaska, night doesn’t fall, it rises. The tide of darkness creeps up the mountains\nslowly and engulfs the alpenglow3 until only the peaks shine pink. One by one they blink\nout like fading beacons, until only Denali lights the sky.\nDenali is not so much to be seen as felt. Elation from the power of the mountain surges\nthrough us. The mountain dwarfs any thoughts we have, any conception we can possess of\nits grandeur. It was and is and will be, while we mortals are as clouds sweeping past its face. …",

        "passage": "…The man responsible for the layout and ambience of the modern shopping center was\nnot an American but a Viennese named Victor Gruen, who fled the Austrian Anschluss1 in\n1938 and arrived in America with just $8 in his pocket. Within twelve years he had become\none of the country’s leading urban planners. Ironically, Gruen’s intention was not to create\na new and more efficient way of shopping but to recreate in America something of the\nunrushed café-society atmosphere of European city centers. Shopping centers—or\nshopping towns, as he preferred to call them—were to be gathering places for the\nneighborhood, focal points of the community where people could stroll and meet their\nfriends, dally over a coffee or an ice cream, and only incidentally shop. Gruen was\nconvinced that he was designing a system that would slow suburban sprawl and tame the\nautomobile. How wrong he was. …\nShopping centers didn’t just transform towns, they often effectively created them. In\nthe late 1940s, Paramus, New Jersey, was a dying little community with no high school, no\ndowntown to speak of, and almost no industry or offices. Then two shopping centers were\nbuilt along Route 4—Macy’s Garden State Plaza and Allied Stores’ Bergen Mall. Within a\ndecade, Paramus’s population had more than quadrupled to 25,000 and its retail sales had\nshot up from $5 million to $125 million. Much the same thing happened to Schaumburg,\nIllinois. In 1956, it had 130 people. Then two things happened: O’Hare became Chicago’s\nmain airport and the Woodfield Shopping Center, with over two million square feet of retail\nspace, was opened. By 1978, Schaumburg’s population had increased almost four-hundredfold to fifty thousand and it was on course to become the second-biggest city in Illinois after\nChicago by the turn of the century.\nAs shopping centers blossomed, downtowns began to die. Between 1948 and 1954, at\nthe height of America’s postwar economic boom, downtown retailers in America’s thirteen\nlargest cities lost on average a quarter of their business. One by one, downtowns grew more\nlifeless as stores and offices fled to the suburbs. Hudson’s Department Store in Detroit\nclosed after watching its annual sales fall from $153 million in 1953 to $45 million in 1981,\nits last year—the victim, ironically of the automobile, the product that had brought Detroit\nits wealth. Sears closed its flagship store on State Street in Chicago in 1983. All over\nAmerica, where downtown department stores survived it was as a matter of pride or of tax\nbreaks, and seldom one of commercial logic. …\nMall shopping had become America’s biggest leisure activity. Mall of America of\nMinneapolis, the country’s biggest mall with 4.2 million square feet of consumer-intensive\nspace (still considerably less than the world’s biggest, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada,\nwith 5.2 million square feet), was forecast to attract more people than the Grand Canyon in\nits first year of business. By the early 1990s, Americans were spending on average twelve\nhours a month in shopping malls, more than they devoted to almost any activity other than\nsleeping, eating, working, and watching television.\nAnd what of Victor Gruen, the man who had started it all? Appalled at what he had\nunleashed, he fled back to Vienna, where he died in 1980, a disappointed man.",

        "passage": "I had just passed through Pillar City in South Field Township, Pennsylvania, juking my\npickup around the potholes on Market Street. It was crowded with anthracite1 coalminer\nshacks lying shoulder-to-shoulder, their front porches a chaos of posts and roofs and\nwrought iron. Nothing so grand as a pillar adorned them. The town looked like a train wreck\nsomeone had forgotten to report, and after two claustrophobic passes down the main drag\nI turned into a side street and out onto a dirt road, pulling into King George’s Filling Station\nand Grille. The King looked at my Vermont license plates through the greasy window and\nwiped his hands on his apron like he might have to reach for something.\nI hadn’t expected the place to be so grim, but even the weather had conspired with the\nshadowless November light. I was studying my road map, trying to find a way back to the\ninterstate without backtracking through town, and I had turned on the dome light so I could\nsee the thin numbered lines when a honey-dew green pickup pulled alongside mine.\nA woman in the passenger seat rolled down the window with a dirty squawk, then\nleaned back in her seat, ramrod straight, as a man leaned over her, head out the window.\n“You lost?” the man said. The woman sat stiffly, as though he had a foul smell or she had\nbeen seized by fear.\n“No, just trying to figure out which way to go from here. I know where I am—thanks\nfor asking,” I said. …\n“You must be lost,” he said.\nSo I decided to explain. “I’m looking up my family history—they’re from around here,\nyears ago. Worley’s the name. Know any Worleys?”\n“I know Worleys.”\n“Oh yeah? Probably distantly related. Think they’d talk to me?” I hadn’t actually\nplanned to look up anyone with the name, but it was a lead.\n“Talk to anyone,” he said. Now the woman in the seat shifted uncomfortably and\nglanced quickly at me. Perhaps she knew Worleys too.\nI asked him to introduce me to anyone named Worley, someone who might be able to\nfill in the gaps in my family tree. The day before I had tracked down an ancestor in the\ncounty courthouse archives, a many-great grandfather Daniel. There I made a photocopy\nof his 1836 will, a list of his worldly goods, which were spare and simple: a spinning wheel,\na splitting maul, two heifers.2 His farm had been in this part of the county, and checking the\nphone book in the Roman Diner I had found a dozen Worleys listed in Pillar City.\nI didn’t explain all of this to the man and woman in the green truck, but they agreed to\nlead me to a house where some Worleys lived. I followed them down another road, a flat,\nwell-graveled route leading straight toward the Upper Tamark Creek. The road made a\nsharp bend at the banks of the creek, and the woman in the truck ahead of me stuck her\narm out of the window, pointing at a two-story frame house sheathed in gray stone halfway\nup. A man was in the side yard, weaving a riding lawnmower around stumps, an overturned\nrowboat, outbuildings, and the carcasses of nameless machines. All the man seemed to be\ndoing was mulching leaves. I pulled into the horseshoe driveway, a little uneasy that the\ngreen truck had not stopped and was now crossing the bridge over the Tamark. …",

        "passage": "The automobile and the motion picture industry are icons of American life. The two\nbecame the perfect match for inventor Richard M. Hollingshead Jr. when he combined\nthem and opened the first drive-in movie theater in Camden, New Jersey, in the summer\nof 1933.\nHollingshead somehow knew that this type of movie theater could eventually prove\nsuccessful, basing his assumption on the fact that a certain segment of the population never\nattended indoor movie houses. He felt confident that once his concept became a reality,\npeople would love the idea of watching movies from inside their automobiles, and he was\nright.\nFamilies were drawn to drive-in movie theaters due in part to their convenience. More\nthan just a movie was offered to the ticket holder: There was no need to get all dressed up,\nyou didn’t have to hire a babysitter, parking was included in the price of the ticket, and\ndinner was just a quick walk to the concession stand. Drive-ins also became popular with\nteenagers because it was the ideal place to take a date or socialize with “the gang.” What\ncould be better than dinner and a movie under the stars?\nToward the latter part of the 1930s, a depressed economy and a world war were just two\nof the reasons for the somewhat slow development of drive-in movie theaters. All of that\nwould change by the mid-1940s.\nAfter the war, America flourished. With a booming economy, hoards of families flocked\nto the suburbs. The setting was perfect for the success of drive-ins. There was plenty of\naffordable, available land and the “car culture” in America was just beginning.\nThe 1950s was the golden age for drive-in movie theaters. More than 4,600 were\nopened for business during the prosperous and defining decade of the baby boom. To lure\nin the family trade, playgrounds were built for children while live bands entertained adults.\nNever mind that the movies were second-rate as was the sound quality—it was the\n“drive-in experience” that kept moviegoers coming back for more.\nAs the decade neared an end, so did the popularity of going to the drive-in. By the\nmid-1960s and well into the 1970s, “the drive-in experience” had become somewhat\ntiresome. The inferior quality of the movies being shown combined with the antiquated\nsound system led many customers back to indoor theaters.\nDuring the 1980s more and more drive-ins began closing down for good. Many owners\njumped at the chance to sell their lots to land developers as a means of getting out of\na sagging business. …\nYet with all its adversity and struggle, the drive-in movie theater has endured. It has\nwithstood the test of time and has become a symbol for a public that is not quite ready to\ngive up on its nostalgic past.\nToday many drive-ins appear to be enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Owners and\noperators, taking pride in their establishments, are now offering Dolby sound along with\nfirst-run movie releases. What began as the idea of one man in Camden, New Jersey, has\nbecome a cultural icon for over half a century. Drive-in movie theaters have been and\nalways will be part of the American landscape.",

        "passage": "…Despite being overstretched, [Chef] Bugnard [of the Cordon Bleu cooking school]\nwas infinitely kind, a natural if understated showman, and he was tireless in his\nexplanations. He drilled us in his careful standards of doing everything the “right way.” He\nbroke down the steps of a recipe and made them simple. And he did so with a quiet\nauthority, insisting that we thoroughly analyze texture and flavor: “But how does it taste,\nMadame Scheeld?”\nOne morning he asked, “Who will make oeufs brouillés today?”\nThe GIs [my fellow students] were silent, so I volunteered for scrambled-egg duty.\nBugnard watched intently as I whipped some eggs and cream into a froth, got the frying pan\nvery hot, and slipped in a pat of butter, which hissed and browned in the pan.\n“Non!” he said in horror, before I could pour the egg mixture into the pan. “That is\nabsolutely wrong!” …\nWith a smile, Chef Bugnard cracked two eggs and added a dash of salt and pepper.\n“Like this,” he said, gently blending the yolks and whites together with a fork. “Not too\nmuch.”\nHe smeared the bottom and sides of the frying pan with butter, then gently poured the\neggs in. Keeping the heat low, he stared intently at the pan. Nothing happened. After a long\nthree minutes, the eggs began to thicken into a custard. Stirring rapidly with the fork,\nsliding the pan on and off the burner, Bugnard gently pulled the egg curds together—“Keep\nthem a little bit loose; this is very important,” he instructed. “Now the cream or butter,” he\nsaid, looking at me with raised eyebrows. “This will stop the cooking, you see?” I nodded,\nand he turned the scrambled eggs out onto a plate, sprinkled a bit of parsley around, and\nsaid, “Voilà!” …\nIt was a remarkable lesson. No dish, not even the humble scrambled egg, was too much\ntrouble for him. “You never forget a beautiful thing that you have made,” he said. “Even\nafter you eat it, it stays with you—always.” …\nI was in pure, flavorful heaven at the Cordon Bleu. Because I had already\nestablished a good basic knowledge of cookery on my own, the classes acted as a catalyst for\nnew ideas, and almost immediately my cooking improved. Before I’d started there, I would\noften put too many herbs and spices into my dishes. But now I was learning the French\ntradition of extracting the full, essential flavors from food—to make, say, a roasted chicken\ntaste really chickeny. …\nBut not everything was perfect. Madame Brassart [the school’s owner] had crammed\ntoo many of us into the class, and Bugnard wasn’t able to give the individual\nattention I craved. There were times when I had a penetrating question to ask, or a fine\npoint that burned inside of me, and I simply wasn’t able to make myself heard. All this had\nthe effect of making me work even harder.\nI had always been content to live a butterfly life of fun, with hardly a care in the world.\nBut at the Cordon Bleu, and in the markets and restaurants of Paris, I suddenly\ndiscovered that cooking was a rich and layered and endlessly fascinating subject. The best\nway to describe it is to say that I fell in love with French food—the tastes, the processes,\nthe history, the endless variations, the rigorous discipline, the creativity, the wonderful\npeople, the equipment, the rituals.\nI had never taken anything so seriously in my life—my husband and cat excepted—and\nI could hardly bear to be away from the kitchen. ...",

It seems that nothing that large could be natural—\nand then it strikes you that something so enormous could only be natural.\nAnother realization soon dawns: These rock-hard floating mountains are dangerous.\nThink not only of the 1912 Titanic disaster but of hundreds of other accidents, most\nrecently the sinking (with no loss of life) of the Antarctic tour ship Explorer in\nNovember 2007. …\nNow, as climate change is raising global temperatures, more icebergs are being born.\nAntarctica generates far more of them than Greenland, the source of bergs in Arctic waters.\nAntarctica’s are also much larger, sometimes reaching the size of small countries. Recent\ndata show the average atmospheric temperature has increased about 4.5 degrees\nFahrenheit in the western Antarctic Peninsula since the 1940s, making the region, along\nwith northwestern North America and Siberia, among the fastest warming on earth. This\njump has been implicated in the recent collapse of major ice shelves along the Antarctic\nPeninsula, including the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008. As a result, thousands of new icebergs\nhave calved, or broken off, from ice shelves into the Southern Ocean at an accelerated rate.\nEven as more icebergs are being created, scientists are learning that these\ndangerous beauties are far from sterile, inert masses of ice. In fact, they dramatically alter\ntheir environments biologically, chemically, and physically, making them islands of life in\nthe open sea. Knowledge of icebergs’ crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem has come only\nin recent years. Observers at sea had long remarked that they attract seals, penguins, and\nseabirds, and divers had noticed that fish are more numerous near them than in the\nsurrounding sea. Now scientists are learning just what the attraction is all about.\nDepending on their size, location, and the season, icebergs can be nurturers or\ndestroyers. During their existence—typically years from calving from an Antarctic or\nGreenlandic glacier to their gradual melting as they drift into lower latitudes—they support\nanimals on, around, even inside their magnificent ramparts. They fertilize the ocean with\nnutrients, boosting plankton production. Grounded bergs can shelter areas of the seafloor,\nprotecting bottom-dwelling creatures from free-floating icebergs, which can be\nbottom-scouring marauders, furrowing the seabed at depths of more than a thousand feet\nlike gigantic plows, destroying all marine life unable to move out of the way. Large bergs\ncan also trap sea ice, impeding its annual breakup and thus depriving phytoplankton (algae\nthat take their name from the Greek words for “plant” and “wanderer”) of life-giving\nsunlight, breaking the food chain at its first link. …\nFrom personal experience, I know that icebergs will continue to astonish and\ncaptivate visitors to the polar regions with their size and ethereal1 beauty. But now—just\nwhen these ecosystems are in rapid flux due to global climate change—these frozen\nmasses are taking on a new dimension of wonder as we uncover their critical role in the\nbiology and chemistry of polar seas. No longer can we look at icebergs as mere passive\nbeauties. They are active agents of change, each one an icy oasis trailing a wake of life as it\ndrifts on its inexorable2 oceanic journey to melting.",

        "passage": "…On the days that M’Dear1 washed her hair, she called them “Days of Beauty.” She\nspent the whole day pampering herself, and she taught me how to pamper myself as well. …\nDuring the wet, cold months that make up a Louisiana winter, M’Dear’s hair was so long\nand thick that drying it could take all day. On those days we’d stay inside, cleaning, ironing,\nand cooking up huge pots of gumbo. I’d climb up onto the big soft chair next to the\nfireplace in the kitchen, and shine shoes or sew on buttons or do the other tasks she was\nteaching me. I’d sit there and watch her work, watch her go in and out of the washroom like\na breeze was blowing her in.\nOn hot Days of Beauty, we’d put on our swimsuits and stand outside on the wooden\nplatform of the outdoor shower. It was my happy job to scrub clean buckets and other\ncontainers and set them outside to gather rainwater to wash our hair. M’Dear would undo\nmy braid, pour the rainwater on my head, put on a little Breck shampoo, and wash my hair.\nThe sun shone down, my mother’s hands touched my head, and her fingers lathered love\ninto me. Never has my hair been so soft. Sometimes I still wash my hair in rainwater, to\nremember.\nAfter our hair was clean, M’Dear would leave hers down, and, still in our swimsuits,\nwe’d hang clean clothes outside to dry on the line, with me handing her clothespins out of\na small apron she had sewn for me out of flower sacks. I have a photo of us by the\nclothesline, doing this very thing. We were working and smiling, squinting slightly in the\nsunlight. I was just about to enter first grade, just about to leave behind those motherdaughter days of intimacy, of little maternal baptisms. M’Dear prepared me for that leaving\nso that it was smooth and felt natural. Not all leavings are that easily prepared for.\nAfter finishing chores and when our hair was dry, M’Dear and I would go down to our\npier, just before sunset. These memories are so vivid to me that I don’t need a photograph\nto see them. I carry them inside me.\nIn one memory, it is growing toward twilight. We are sitting on the pier with the La\nLuna River flowing by. …\nAnd as the sun sparkled off the cocoa-red water and the wind stirred in the tall pines,\nI stood behind my mother, my legs on either side of her, and brushed her hair. I lifted her\nlong chestnut hair up off her neck, twirled it up on top of her head, then let it fall,\nwatching its weight settle back down and around her shoulders. Then I’d lean my face into\nher hair and smell it. I can close my eyes and smell it now: sun and vanilla.\nWhat I first learned about love, I learned on that dock with M’Dear. The La Luna River\nflowing by with its river sounds, the riverbanks with their lovely sweet citrus scent of\njasmine, the scent of M’Dear’s hair, the oils of her scalp, the fullness of her thick, long curls\nagainst my hands, our breathing together, the closeness, her love for me—all of this knit my\nsoul together. When the fading sunlight hit the river, it bounced up to form iridescence, like\na halo, around M’Dear’s head. She is the most beautiful person in the universe. …",

        "passage": "During her junior year of high school, Candice Backus’s teacher handed her a worksheet\nand instructed the 17-year-old to map out her future financial life. Backus pretended to buy\na car, rent an apartment, and apply for a credit card. Then, she and her classmates played\nthe “stock market game,” investing the hypothetical earnings from their hypothetical jobs\nin the market in the fateful fall of 2008. “Our pretend investments crashed,” Backus says,\nstill horrified. “We felt what actual shareholders were feeling.”\nThat pain of earning and losing money is a feeling that public schools increasingly want\nto teach. Forty states now offer some type of financial instruction at the elementary or\nhigh-school level, embedding lessons in balancing checkbooks and buying stock into math\nand social-studies classes. Though it’s too early to measure the full impact of the Great\nRecession, anecdotally the interest in personal-finance classes has risen since 2007 when\nsubprime became a four-letter word and bank failures a regular occurrence. Now, a handful\nof states including Missouri, Utah, and Tennessee require teenagers to take financialliteracy classes to graduate from high school. School districts such as Chicago are boosting\ntheir offerings in money-management classes for kids as young as elementary school, and\nroughly 300 colleges or universities now offer online personal-finance classes for incoming\nstudents. “These classes really say, ‘This is how you live independently,’ ” says Ted Beck,\npresident of National Endowment for Financial Education.\nRather than teach investment strategies or financial wizardry, these courses offer a backto-the-basics approach to handling money: Don’t spend what you don’t have. Put part of\nyour monthly salary into a savings account, and invest in the stock market for the long-term\nrather than short-term gains. For Backus, this means dividing her earnings from her\npart-time job at a fast-food restaurant into separate envelopes for paying bills, spending,\nand saving. “Money is so hard to make but so easy to spend,” she says one weekday after\nschool. “That was the big takeaway.”\nTeaching kids about the value of cash certainly is one of the programs’ goals, but teachers\nalso want students to think hard about their finances long term. It’s easy for teenagers to get\nriled up about gas prices because many of them drive cars. But the hard part is urging them\nto put off the instant gratification of buying a new T shirt or an iPod. “Investing and retirement\naren’t things teenagers are thinking about. For them, the future is this weekend,” says Gayle\nWhitefield, a business and marketing teacher at Utah’s Riverton High School. …\nThat’s a big goal for these classes: preventing kids from making the same financial\nmissteps their parents did when it comes to saving, spending, and debt. Though the\npersonal savings rate has shot up to 4.2 percent as of July 2009, that’s still a far distance from\n1982, when Americans saved 11.2 percent of their incomes. It’s hard for schools to teach\nstrict money-management skills when teenagers go home and watch their parents rack up\ncredit-card debt. It’s like telling your kids not to smoke and then lighting up a cigarette in\nfront of them, Beck says. …\nEven with these challenges, students such as Backus say learning about money in school\nis worthwhile. After Backus finished her financial-literacy class, she opened up a savings\naccount at her local bank and started to think more about how she and her family would pay\nfor college. “She just has a better understanding of money and how it affects the world,”\nsays her mother, Darleen—and that’s down to the minutiae1 of how money is spent at-large\nfrom taxes to bank bailouts to the federal government’s deficit. All of this talk of money can\nmake Backus worry, she says, but luckily, she feels prepared to face it.",

The grass would\nbrush the underside of the pickup and you could hear it. Or if we didn’t drive, we walked\nout there. Talk about tall grass. If you walked out there, you had to go through the big\npasture by the north pond. That pasture had tall fescue grass1 you had to wade through. If\nyou sat down, the horizon vanished, the trees on the edge of the field vanished. You could\nsee just a few feet into the grass, and you could see sky. That was all. You could flatten down\nthe grass to make a little sitting area. You could make a path to another sitting area and have\ntwo sitting areas and a path. Of course, once the grass was cut for hay, there’d be no more\nof that kind of thing. The grass on the front hill was the same.\nThey were wild blackberries. Picking them was fun for about the first twelve berries,\nthen it was work, but you were allowed to eat as many as you wanted. Fresh blackberries\nmeant you got a cobbler for dinner. You could also put them on your cereal with honey. The\nsecond day, maybe we would crumble hot biscuits into bowls, then sprinkle them with\nberries, then add milk or cream, then add honey. It was almost the best thing a person could\neat. There was no name for it, so when you wanted it you had to say the whole thing:\n“Biscuits with berries on them and then milk and honey in a bowl.” It was a breakfast or a\ndessert for lunch or dinner or a snack for after dinner or night. That’s what it was. It was all\nof that. …\nThe brambles would scratch you when you were picking berries. Like how a kitten\nscratches you on your arms, even though they don’t mean it. Also, there were ticks,\nchiggers and poison ivy. The hazards of the blackberry patch. You never saw any snakes out\nthere, but for some reason you were always told that there might be snakes. A watchful eye\nwas required.\nIt felt like a long way from the house, even though you could look across the pastures\nand see the house on the hill, residing in the elm shade. Still, it felt like you were really out\nsomewhere. You knew the creek was not too far away. You couldn’t hear any roads from\nthere. If you looked up, maybe there was a jet making a line in the sky. Not that you could\nsee the actual jet, just the line. …\nBefore blackberry month, there were trips to pick strawberries at strawberry farms. For\nabout three days you ate as many strawberries as humanly possible. The rest had to be\ncleaned, sliced, sugared and frozen. Then there were trips to go pick blueberries. And then\nyou ate as many of them as humanly possible. The rest had to be cleaned and frozen. Or\ncanned. Canning happened at night because it was too hot to do during the day and it\nhelped a lot if Dad was home to pitch in. The shadows slanted across the yard.\nThe shadows slanted across the garden. A horsefly droned past, on his way to\nsomewhere else. The barn swallows swooped and banked above the horse pasture. They\nspiraled, dove. Their forked tails.\nOne flew right between the legs of the horse. You saw it. …",

        "passage": "From San Francisco to New York to Paris, city governments, high-class restaurants,\nschools, and religious groups are ditching bottled water in favor of what comes out of the\nfaucet. With people no longer content to pay 1,000 times as much for bottled water, a\nproduct no better than water from the tap, a backlash against bottled water is growing.\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents some 1,100 American cities,\ndiscussed at its June 2007 meeting the irony of purchasing bottled water for city employees\nand for city functions while at the same time touting1 the quality of municipal water. The\ngroup passed a resolution sponsored by Mayors Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, Rocky\nAnderson of Salt Lake City, and R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis that called for the examination\nof bottled water’s environmental impact. The resolution noted that with $43 billion a year\ngoing to provide clean drinking water in cities across the country, “the United States’\nmunicipal water systems are among the finest in the world.”…\nTap water promotional campaigns would have seemed quaint a few decades ago, when\nwater in bottles was a rarity. Now such endeavors are needed to counteract the pervasive2\nmarketing that has caused consumers to lose faith in the faucet. In fact, more than a quarter\nof bottled water is just processed tap water, including top-selling Aquafina and Coca-Cola’s\nDasani. When Pepsi announced in July [2007] that it would clearly label its Aquafina water\nas from a “public water source,” it no doubt shocked everyone who believed that\nbottles with labels depicting pristine mountains or glaciers delivered a superior product. …\nWith sales growing by 10 percent each year, far faster than any other beverage, bottled\nwater now appears to be the drink of choice for many Americans—they swallow more of it\nthan milk, juice, beer, coffee, or tea. While some industry analysts are counting on bottled\nwater to beat out carbonated soft drinks to top the charts in the near future, the\nburgeoning3 back-to-the-tap movement may reverse the trend.\nIn contrast to tap water, which is delivered through an energy-efficient infrastructure,\nbottled water is an incredibly wasteful product. It is usually packaged in single-serving\nplastic bottles made with fossil fuels. Just manufacturing the 29 billion plastic bottles used\nfor water in the United States each year requires the equivalent of more than 17 million\nbarrels of crude oil.\nAfter being filled, the bottles may travel far. Nearly one quarter of bottled water\ncrosses national borders before reaching consumers, and part of the cachet4 of certain\nbottled water brands is their remote origin. Adding in the Pacific Institute’s estimates for\nthe energy used for pumping and processing, transportation, and refrigeration, brings the\nannual fossil fuel footprint of bottled water consumption in the United States to over 50\nmillion barrels of oil equivalent—enough to run 3 million cars for one year. If everyone\ndrank as much bottled water as Americans do, the world would need the equivalent of more\nthan 1 billion barrels of oil to produce close to 650 billion individual bottles. …\nSlowing sales may be the wave of the future as the bottle boycott movement picks up\nspeed. With more than 1 billion people around the globe still lacking access to a safe and\nreliable source of water, the $100 billion the world spends on bottled water every year could\ncertainly be put to better use creating and maintaining safe public water infrastructure\neverywhere.",

        "passage": "I was lucky enough to discover my passion for flying when I was very young, and to\nindulge that passion day after day. Lucky that some things went my way; my eyesight, for\ninstance, was good enough to allow me to become a fighter pilot. And lucky that when I left\nthe military, I found work as an airline pilot, when such jobs weren’t plentiful.\nI still feel fortunate, after all these years, to be able to follow my passion. The airline\nindustry has its problems, and a lot of the issues can be troubling and wearying, but I still\nfind purpose and satisfaction in flying.\nThere’s a literal freedom you feel when you’re at the controls, gliding above the surface\nof the earth, no longer bound by gravity. It’s as if you’re rising above the nitty-gritty details\nof life. Even at a few thousand feet, you get a wider perspective. Problems that loom large\ndown below feel smaller from that height, and smaller still by the time you reach thirty-five\nthousand feet.\nI love that flying is an intellectual challenge, and that there’s mental math that needs to\nbe done all along the way. If you change the angle of the nose versus the horizon by even\none degree while traveling at a typical commercial airliner speed of seven nautical miles a\nminute, it’s enough to increase or decrease your rate of climb or descent by seven hundred\nfeet per minute. I enjoy keeping track of all the calculations, staying aware of the weather\nconditions, working with a team—flight attendants, air traffic controllers, first officers,\nmaintenance crews—while knowing intimately what the plane can and cannot do. Even\nwhen the controls are being manipulated through automation, pilots have to back up the\ncomputer systems with their own mental math. I like the challenge of that.\nI also like sharing my passion for flying. It’s a disappointment to me that a lot of kids\ntoday aren’t especially fascinated by flight. I’ve watched countless children walk past the\ncockpit without paying much attention; they’re too focused on their video games or their\niPods.\nWhen there are children who eagerly want a look inside “my office” at the front of the\nplane, their enthusiasm is contagious. It’s so gratifying to see their excitement about something I care deeply about. If we aren’t busy during boarding, the first officer and I enjoy\ninviting inquisitive children to sit in our seats in the cockpit, ask questions, and let their\nparents take photos of them wearing a captain’s hat.\nBeing a pilot has a tangible end result that is beneficial to society. It feels good to take\na planeload of 183 people where they need or want to go. My job is to reunite people with\nfamily and friends, to send them on long-awaited vacations, to bring them to loved ones’\nfunerals, to get them to their job interviews. By the end of a day, after piloting three or four\ntrips, I’ve taken four or five hundred people safely to their destinations, and I feel as if I’ve\naccomplished something. All of them have their own stories, motivations, needs—and\nhelping them brings a rewarding feeling.\nThis is what gets me ready for work, and one of the things I look forward to. …",

        "passage": "The steamboat Bertrand was heavily laden with provisions when it set out on the\nMissouri River in 1865, destined for the gold mining camps in Fort Benton, Mont[ana]. The\nboat snagged and swamped under the weight, sinking to the bottom of the river. It was\nfound a century later, under 30 feet of silt a little north of Omaha, Neb[raska].\nAmong the canned food items retrieved from the Bertrand in 1968 were brandied\npeaches, oysters, plum tomatoes, honey, and mixed vegetables. In 1974, chemists at the\nNational Food Processors Association (NFPA) analyzed the products for bacterial\ncontamination and nutrient value. Although the food had lost its fresh smell and\nappearance, the NFPA chemists detected no microbial growth and determined that the\nfoods were as safe to eat as they had been when canned more than 100 years earlier. …\nCanned foods are more than a relic dug from the past. They make up 12 percent of\ngrocery sales in the United States. More than 1,500 food products are canned—including\nmany that aren’t available fresh in most areas, such as elderberry, guava, mango, and about\n75 different juice drinks. Consumers can buy at least 130 different canned vegetable\nproducts—from artichokes and asparagus to turnips and zucchini. More than a dozen kinds\nof beef are canned, including beef burgers and chopped, corned and barbecued beef. …\nFood-spoiling bacteria, yeasts and molds are naturally present in foods. To grow, these\nmicroorganisms need moisture, a low-acid environment (acid prevents bacterial growth),\nnutrients, and an appropriate (usually room) temperature.\nDennis Dignan, Ph.D., chief of FDA’s [Food and Drug Administration’s] food processing\nsection, explains that foods are preserved from food spoilage by controlling one or more of\nthe above factors. For instance, frozen foods are stored at temperatures too low for\nmicroorganisms (bacteria, yeasts and molds) to grow. When foods are dried, sufficient\nmoisture is not available to promote growth.\nIt is the preservation process that distinguishes canned from other packaged foods.\nDuring canning, the food is placed in an airtight (hermetically sealed) container and heated\nto destroy microorganisms. The hermetic seal is essential to ensure that microorganisms do\nnot contaminate the product after it is sterilized through heating, says Dignan. Properly\ncanned foods can be stored unrefrigerated indefinitely without fear of their spoiling or\nbecoming toxic. …\nDignan also notes that foods packaged in materials other than metal cans are considered\n“canned” by food processing specialists if the food undergoes the canning preservation\nprocess. Thus, today a canned food may be packaged in a number of other types of\ncontainers, such as glass jars, paperboard cans, and plastics that can be formed into anything\nfrom pouches to soup bowls to serving trays. …\nFoods with a naturally high acid content—such as tomatoes, citrus juices, pears, and\nother fruits—will not support the growth of food poisoning bacteria. In tests, when large\nnumbers of food poisoning bacteria are added to these foods, the bacteria die within a day.\n(The exact amount of time depends upon the bacteria and amount of acidity.) Foods that\nhave a high acid content, therefore, do not receive as extreme a heat treatment as low-acid\nfoods. They are heated sufficiently to destroy bacteria, yeasts and molds that could cause\nfood to spoil. …\nLow-acid canned foods receive a high dose of heat—usually 107 degrees Celsius\n(250 degrees Fa[h]renheit) for at least three minutes. (The amount of time the food is heat-\ned, though, depends upon the size of the container and the product.) The canned food\nis heated in a retort, a kind of pressure cooker. …\nAnother critical element in the canned food process is sealing products in airtight\ncontainers. It is essential that air be removed from the container before sealing. Air could\ncause the can to expand during heating, perhaps damaging the seals or seams of the\ncontainer.\nA telltale sign of loss of this vacuum1\n—and a possibly contaminated product—is a can\nwith bulging ends. If a seal is not airtight, bacteria may enter the can, multiply, and\ncontaminate the product. …",

        "passage": "On the day that gold was discovered near his village, Mohammed Muda Nor had\nworked all morning tapping rubber.1 At one o’clock he walked out from the airy rows of\ntrees, waved to Abdullah, the entry guard, who was already eating his lunch, and started\ndown the dusty road home. The call to prayer wavered from the village mosque, and it\nseemed to Muda that he could see it, waves of sound shimmering concurrently with the\nmidday heat. It was the end of the fruit season, one of the last hot weeks before the rains\nbegan, and the weather was a fiery hand against his back. Muda walked with his straw hat\npulled down low over his forehead, so he didn’t see the children running toward him until\nthey were quite near. They circled around him and pulled in close, like the petals on a closing\nflower.\n“Pachik Muda.” It was his oldest nephew, a boy named Amin. He was wearing shorts\nand holding the hand of his youngest sister, Maimunah, who stood brown and naked beside\nhim. “Uncle, our mother says for you to come quickly to the river.” …\n“Tell your mother,” he said, “that I will come later. Right now I am going for my lunch.”\nHe expected them to run off then. They were the children of his sister, Norliza, and they\nwere rarely naughty. But instead Amin released his sister’s hand. He reached out and\ntugged at Muda’s sarong.2\n“My mother says to come,” he repeated. “Please, Pachik Muda, she says it is important.”\nMuda sighed then, but he turned and followed the children back along the road. Red\nrambutans3 and smooth green mangoes hung from the trees. He plucked some of these and\nate them as he walked, wondering what he would find on the riverbank. Norliza had worked\nthe rubber too, before she married, and she would not take him lightly from his rest and\nprayers.\nWhen he reached the river he saw a cluster of women standing on the grassy bank.\nNorliza was in the center, her sarong wet to the knees, holding something out for the\nothers to see.\n“Norliza,” he called. He was going to scold her for consuming his time with her bit of\nwoman’s nonsense, but before he could speak she ran to him and uncurled her fist. The\nlines in her palm were creased with dirt, so that the skin around them looked very pale. The\nwords he had planned stopped in his mouth. For on her palm lay a piece of gold as large as\na knuckle. It was wet with river water, and it caught the noon light like fire in her hand.\n“The children found it,” she said. “I was digging for roots.” Norliza was a midwife,\nknown in the village for her skill with herbs and massage. She came into the jungle every\nweek to search for the healing roots and bark. “I was digging there, near the trees by the\nriver. The children were playing next to me, sorting out the rocks for a game. This one they\nliked because of its shine. At first I did not realize. It was only when Amin washed it in the\nriver that I understood.” Her dark eyes gleamed with an unfamiliar excitement. “To think,”\nshe said. “To think he might have dropped it, and I would never have known.”\nMuda reached out and took the knot of gold. It was smooth, almost soft, against his\nfingers. He ran his thumb against it again and again. Some of the women drew close to\nstare. Others, he noticed, were already moving away with the news. …",

        "passage": "Norman Rockwell didn’t create his celebrated images using only brush and paint. They\noften took shape first as scenes that Rockwell literally acted out, not only for his editors at\nthe [Saturday Evening] Post, but his real-life models, too. “It was strenuous,” he once\nexplained, “but I felt it was the best way to get across my meaning.” And so he would\nenthusiastically play out his visions and ideas, a one-man show packed with just the right\nexpressions, giving enough details of each persona in the scene to inspire his models and,\nmore importantly, get his editors to buy his ideas.\nNow, more than 30 years after his death, Rockwell is still acknowledged for deftly1\nchronicling the best of 20th century American life with vignettes2 of simple emotions\nevoked by everyday people. This phenomenon is a resounding testament to Rockwell’s\nprowess as a storyteller and is the subject of another kind of one-man show: the upcoming\nexhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., titled Telling\nStories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The\nexhibit, assembled from the private collections of these two popular film directors, will\nfeature rarely viewed pieces of Rockwell’s work, including George Lucas’ favorite, Lands of\nEnchantment, which shows a youngster imagining himself as an armor-clad knight riding\naway with a beautiful girl. The point is not the boy reading, but how the book inspires the\nboy’s imagination, taking him, in idealized form, to another time and place. …\n“Storytelling was very important to Norman Rockwell,” says Lucas. “Every image has\neither the middle or the end of a story, and you can already see the beginning even though\nit’s not there. You can see all the missing parts of the story because he took that one frame\nthat sort of tells you everything you need to know.\n“And, of course, in filmmaking we strive for that. We strive to get images that convey,\nvisually, a lot of information without having to spend a lot of time at it. Norman Rockwell\nwas a master at that—he was a master at telling a story in one frame,” explains Lucas.\nThat concentration of information as well as emotion is something inherent3 in\nRockwell’s art. Emotion certainly spoke to Steven Spielberg when he first saw one of his\nfavorite Rockwell paintings, High Dive, the August 16, 1947 Post cover that depicts a boy\nat the top of what must be (or so we imagine from the boy’s expression) a towering diving\nboard. He crouches high above a swimming pool, too afraid to either jump or climb back\ndown. The painting hangs in Spielberg’s office at Amblin Entertainment because it holds a\ngreat deal of meaning for the filmmaker. …\nEven in the creation of their work, Spielberg and Rockwell were more similar than is\nimmediately evident. To create his meticulously detailed recollections of everyday\nAmerican life, Rockwell worked much like a film director, not just acting out the scenes in his\nimagination, but scouting locations, casting everyday people from his town for particular\nparts, choosing costumes and props, and directing his performers to make them instantly\nfamiliar to the public. Little wonder then, that filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, as well\nas others, should be so inspired by his work.\nIn directing his own scenes, Rockwell had a specific focus, just not one based on the\nstark realism in which he grew up. Instead, Rockwell aimed to depict life in a kind of\nrealistic fantasy. He later remarked in his autobiography, My Adventures as an Illustrator,\n“I paint the world not as it is, but as I would like it to be.” …",

        "passage": "Skippy was the least important occupant of the house. He was loved, but he was never\nconsulted. It was taken for granted that the family’s will was his will, and that he would\nfollow blindly. He was their dog.\nWhen the family decided to move, Skippy was not invited to voice his views. They\ndecided quite suddenly, on a day when everything seemed to go wrong. Mrs. Adams\nwatched the first prize go to Mrs. Cranston at the flower show. Mr. Adams came home from\nthe publishing house with a book to read and report on, and Mrs. Adams followed him up\nto their bedroom, where he had retired to escape the sounds of banging doors, telephones,\nand dinner preparations.\nBuzz Adams stormed in cross as sticks because Sally, who lived next door, had given him\nback his class ring. Chottie Adams drifted in dreamily from her first meeting with a tall, dark\nand handsome young man. When the Adamses sat down to dinner, they began a round of\ngrievances.\nMrs. Adams said, with her mouth beginning to waver again, “It isn’t that Lila Cranston\nhas a better growing hand than I have. It’s because she has a bigger garden. She doesn’t\nhave to crowd things and let them run riot. I don’t know what I wouldn’t give to move to a\nhouse with extensive grounds.”\nMr. Adams said vehemently, “I’d like to move, too. I’d like a house big enough to allow me\nthe luxury of a room of my own.”\n“I wish we lived in a stately house,” said Chottie wistfully. “Every corner in this house is\ncrammed with Daddy’s old books. We live so informally.”\n“If I may put my two cents in,” Buzz offered miserably, “I hate this whole neighborhood.”\n“That’s it!” said Mr. Adams excitedly. “We will move tomorrow, not get out actually, but\ntomorrow I’ll see the agent for the Thayer place. It’s quite an estate, but I can swing it and\nthe peace is worth the price.”…\nHaving arrived at this hasty decision to move within a matter of days, the Adamses\nsettled down to their excellent dinner, which they all ate with relish, for each thought that\nthe major problem in his life had just been solved.\nExcept Skippy, who, until this moment, had had no problems. He lay under the table in\nhis accustomed place by Buzz’ feet. Usually his head was up, his ears pointing forward, his\nmouth ajar to release his eager panting, his tongue extended, and his expression one of\nsublime expectancy. But as the human voices grew impassioned, Skippy’s keen perception\nnoted the shades of discontent expressed in each. He cocked his head and began to listen\nintently. …\nSkippy loved the house. He had lived in it practically all his life. Actually, you might\nalmost say it was his. For the thing was, the Adamses had bought it because of him. He had been\ngiven to Buzz as a birthday surprise when he, Skippy, was three months old. Until then he had\nlived in a kennel which could not be considered home life. He and Buzz had recognized\neach other instantly as dog lover and boy worshiper. Two days later the apartment house\nagent came over to register the complaint of the people downstairs, who could not accustom\ntheir ears to the overwhelming sounds of a boy and his dog. The dog, the agent explained\nregretfully, must go. \nThey moved to a house in the suburbs as soon as a suitable one could be found. It was\na move the elder Adamses had been meaning to make ever since Chottie was born, but one\nthing and another kept them chained to the city. And 14 years later a little dog led them to\nthe charming white house that might have emerged from their dreams. …\nNow, after five years, as if they had slyly waited until he reached the age when the most\nobliging dog balks at change and views the moving of his basket from one corner to another\nas a complete upheaval of his lifetime habits, the Family was preparing to depart. …",

        "passage": "Elizabeth Blake suspended three flint blades from a small wooden frame. Holding her\ncell phone in one hand, she took a piece of antler in the other and gently struck each blade\nonce. Over a bad transatlantic connection, our phone conversation had been difficult, but\nthe tones from the four-inch-long blades came through—clear, sweet, and crystalline.1 They\nsounded like hand bells or struck goblets. The blades are replicas of 30,000-year-old\nartifacts from the sites of Isturitz in the French Pyrenees and Geißenklösterle in\nsouthwestern Germany.\nBlake, who is the granddaughter of an opera singer and the daughter of a pianist, is an\narchaeology graduate student at Cambridge University. One of the newest members of a\ndeveloping sub-discipline, the archaeology of music, she is basing her research on the\nhypothesis that our earliest ancestors discovered and enjoyed a peculiar property of some\nstone tools—they rang. …\nThe major difficulty that prehistoric musicologists face is that it’s so easy to make music\nwithout leaving a trace. In addition to dancing and singing, hunter-gatherer cultures used\nnatural materials to create instruments. Native Americans shook rattles made from gourds.\nAustralian aborigines played instruments called didgeridoos fashioned from huge tree limbs\nor bamboo. The San of southwest Africa plucked the gut strings of their wooden hunting\nbows. What are the odds these would survive for thousands of years to be found (let alone\ncorrectly identified) by an archaeologist? The best anyone can expect to discover is when\nhumans first began to create reliable and durable instruments.\nGraeme Lawson, an independent archaeologist in England who heads a multidisciplinary2\norganization known as Cambridge Music-Archaeological Research believes that some\nobjects now on display in museums may actually be misidentified musical artifacts. One\ncase in point is a medieval “garment clasp” that was made from a pig knuckle. Lawson\nanalyzed the wear patterns and polish around a hole that had been drilled through the\ncenter of the bone and showed they were consistent with the patterns found on “buzz\nbones,” a type of noise maker that was used as a children’s toy in some parts of Europe until\na few decades ago. When the knuckle bone was tied to a string and whirled through the air,\nit would have made an eerie, ghostlike sound.\nHow many ancient objects now labeled as “garment clasps” were actually used as noise\nmakers? How many flint artifacts doubled as chimes? There’s plenty for an avid music\narchaeologist to do without ever touching a spade.\nThe oldest indisputably musical artifacts are flutes (experts call them “pipes”) made\nfrom the bones of birds. They come from two sites, Isturitz and Geißenklösterle. The pipes\nwere found in excavation levels associated with Europe’s earliest modern human\npopulation, the Aurignacian culture. The people at these sites created jewelry, made\npaintings, and crafted sculptures that represented human figures, showing that music was\njust one part of an artistic revolution that started in Africa more than 100,000 years ago and\nwas brought to Europe by anatomically modern humans around 40,000 years ago. …\nWhat does survive, of course, is stone. It may seem odd to think of stones as musical,\nbut [Ian] Cross [a Cambridge musicologist] points out that so-called lithophones have been\ndocumented in many cultures. Musicologists and anthropologists have recorded or\ndescribed ringing stones and “rock gongs” in India, the Americas, Europe, Southeast Asia,\nand Africa.\nWhen Cross first began to explore the potential of flint blades as lithophones, he\nconsidered them as percussion instruments like primitive castanets.3 Touched together,\nthey do make a dull click. It took an archaeologist and a skilled flint-knapper to point out\nthe larger possibilities. Ezra Zubrow of SUNY Buffalo and Frank Cowan of the Cincinnati\nMuseum of Natural History showed Cross that thin, elongated pieces of flint could produce\na tone like a chime. You could say that the idea resonated. …",

        "passage": "In all years and all seasons, The Bridge was there. We could see it from the roof of the\ntenement where we lived, the stone towers rising below us from the foreshortened streets\nof downtown Brooklyn. We saw it in newspapers and at the movies and on the covers of\nbooks, part of the signature of the place where we lived. Sometimes, on summer afternoons\nduring World War II, my mother would gather me and my brother Tom and my sister,\nKathleen, and we’d set out on the most glorious of walks. We walked for miles, leaving\nbehind the green of Prospect Park, passing factories and warehouses and strange\nneighborhoods, crossing a hundred streets and a dozen avenues, seeing the streets turn\ngreen again as we entered Brooklyn Heights, pushing on, beaded with sweat, legs rubbery,\nuntil, amazingly, looming abruptly in front of us, stone and steel and indifferent, was The\nBridge.\nIt was the first man-made thing that I knew was beautiful. We could walk across it,\ngazing up at the great arc of the cables. We could hear the sustained eerie musical note they\nmade when combed by the wind (and augmented since by the hum of automobile tires),\nand we envied the gulls that played at the top of those arches. The arches were Gothic, and\nprovided a sense of awe that was quite religious. And awe infused the view of the great\nharbor, a view my mother embellished by describing to us the ships that had brought her\nand so many other immigrants to America—the Irish and the Italians and the Jews, the\nGermans, the Poles, and the Swedes, all of them crowding the decks, straining to see their\nnewfound land. What they saw first was the Statue of Liberty, and the skyline, and The\nBridge. The Brooklyn Bridge. …\nThere was a long time in my life when I didn’t see much of The Bridge, except from the\nroof or the back window. The reason was simple: Trolleys were replaced by automobiles,\nand nobody I knew in our neighborhood owned a car. But then when I was sixteen, I got a\njob in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a sheet-metal worker, and at lunchtime we would wander\nout along the cobblestone streets beside the dry docks, and from there we could look up at\nThe Bridge. “Now the cats that built that,” a black welder named Fred Thompson said to\nme one day, “they knew what they were doin’.”\nThey certainly did. As I grew older, I came increasingly to see The Bridge as a\nmonument to craft. It was New York’s supreme example of the Well-Made Thing. All\naround us in the sixties, the standards of craft eroded. As aestheticians1 proclaimed the\nvirtues of the spontaneous, or exalted the bold gesture, or condemned form as an artistic\nstraitjacket, I would cross The Bridge and wonder what they could mean. More than\ntwenty men were killed in the construction of this thing, and others were ruined for life by\naccidents and disease suffered in its service. To those men, carelessness meant death, not\nsimply for themselves, but for the human beings who would use what they were making. So\nthey had no choice: They had to make it to last. And in doing so, in caring about detail and\nfunction and strength, they saw craft triumph into art. …\nOf course, it is the nature of all bridges that they travel in two directions. I know dozens\nof people who traveled west on The Bridge, wandered the world, and then made the long,\nwide circle home to Brooklyn. I don’t know anybody who ever did that from the Bronx.\nFrom the Manhattan shore, The Bridge still seems to whisper: “Come, travel across me. It’s\nonly 1,562 feet across the river, and over here, and beyond, lies Oz, or Camelot, or\nYoknapatawpha County.”2 And from the Brooklyn side it speaks in plain, bourgeois3 tones,\nwith a plain, simple message: “Come home.” …",

        "passage": "The common raven (Corvus corax) holds a special fascination for bird lovers because of\nits complex, even baffling behaviors and its aura of mystery—which are revealed in fact and\nembellished in legend.\nThis denizen1 of northern latitudes and high altitude is North America’s largest\npasserine, or perching bird, and a relative of the crow. With a length of 24-26 inches and a\nwingspan in excess of four feet, this iridescent black bird presents an imposing sight\nespecially when it skillfully executes hawk-like flight motions during courtship displays and\nwhile guarding its nest. The raven, you see, is a bit of an aerial acrobat and seems to fly for\nthe sheer joy of it. Rolls, somersaults and even level flight upside-down may be the most\nspectacular behaviors the casual birder will be able to observe.\nBecause both birds are large, black, and similarly shaped, it can be hard to tell the\ncommon raven from the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In addition to being\nsomewhat larger, ravens have a heavier beak with a decided “Roman nose” appearance.\nThey also have shaggy throat feathers, called hackles, which can be slicked down or fluffed\nout, apparently to aid communication. In flight, their rounded, wedge-shaped tails and\nfeathers resemble extended fingers near the ends of their wings. …\nThe raven is both predator and scavenger. Although omnivorous, most of its diet is\nanimal matter, including insects, lizards, frogs, rodents and the eggs and young of other\nbirds. In addition, it regularly dines on carrion2 and garbage.\nThe raven’s sometimes inexplicable and genuinely annoying habits—they’ve been\nknown to harass livestock and pets, pilfer golf balls and peck holes in the skins of\nunattended light airplanes—led to human reactions that thinned its ranks, particularly in\nthe Northeast. This bird has made a remarkable comeback in the last few decades,\nhowever, partly due to its ability to take advantage of the presence of people. The raven can\nsurvive everything from arctic to desert conditions, often aided, ironically, by garbage\ndumps and other artifacts of human settlement. …\nRaven pairs stay together throughout the breeding season and usually bond for life.\nCourtship displays generally begin in February, just before breeding. Pairs often return to\nprevious nesting areas and begin a spectacular aerial courtship ritual. They perform unison\nflight maneuvers, sometimes circling their chosen nest site with wingtips nearly touching.\nOccasionally, the male takes steep, sudden dives or tumbles in mid-air. Feather-preening\nseems to be a common activity while earthbound.\nRavens prefer remote, forested areas with tall coniferous trees or rocky ledges where\nthey can build nests and catch air currents that loft them into soaring flights. They also nest\non rugged seacoasts and forested marine islands, as are found off the coast of Maine. …\nNests tend to be built in solitary places, typically miles from other raven nests.\nSometimes, new nests are built atop old ones, although nesting pairs may alternate among\ntwo or more sites in the same nesting area from year to year. In this way, the best nesting\nareas can be used for 100 years or more. …\nMany a researcher has discovered firsthand the cunning ways of the raven. Generally\nacknowledged to be among the most intelligent of birds, ravens display a seeming social\nawareness, even with other species, and surprising problem-solving abilities.\nAccounts abound of ravens closely following large predators such as wolves or coyotes,\nand of sharing, unmolested, in their kills once the carnivores opened the carcasses.\nAlthough this could be seen as just opportunistic feeding, the easy relationship between the\nspecies seems to hint at something more substantial.\nInuit3 hunting traditions advise watching where ravens circle and dip their wings as a\nsure tipoff to the location of game. Some speculate that ravens actually use their aerial\nvantage points to guide larger, stronger predators to prey, which they then share. …",

        "passage": "Call walked the river for an hour, though he knew there was no real need. It was just an\nold habit he had, left over from wilder times: checking, looking for [a] sign of one kind or\nanother, honing his instincts, as much as anything. In his years as a Ranger captain it had\nbeen his habit to get off by himself for a time, every night, out of camp and away from\nwhatever talking and bickering were going on. He had discovered early on that his instincts\nneeded privacy in which to operate. Sitting around a fire being sociable, yawning and\nyarning, might be fine in safe country, but it could cost you an edge in country that wasn’t\nso safe. He liked to get off by himself, a mile or so from camp, and listen to the country, not\nthe men.\nOf course, real scouting skills were superfluous in a place as tame as Lonesome Dove,\nbut Call still liked to get out at night, sniff the breeze and let the country talk. The country\ntalked quiet; one human voice could drown it out, particularly if it was a voice as loud as\nAugustus McCrae’s. Augustus was notorious all over Texas for the strength of his voice. On\na still night he could be heard at least a mile, even if he was more or less\nwhispering. Call did his best to get out of range of Augustus’s voice so that he could relax\nand pay attention to other sounds. If nothing else, he might get a clue as to what weather\nwas coming—not that there was much mystery about the weather around Lonesome Dove.\nIf a man looked straight up at the stars he was apt to get dizzy, the night was so clear. Clouds\nwere scarcer than cash money, and cash money was scarce enough.\nThere was really little in the way of a threat to be looked for, either. A coyote might\nsneak in and snatch a chicken, but that was about the worst that was likely to happen. The\nmere fact that he and Augustus were there had long since discouraged the local\nhorsethieves. …\nHe tried hard to keep sharp, but in fact the only action he had scared up in six months\nof watching the river was one bandit, who might just have been a vaquero1 with a thirsty\nhorse. All Call had had to do in that instance was click the hammer of his Henry—in the\nstill night the click had been as effective as a shot. The man wheeled back into Mexico, and\nsince then nothing had disturbed the crossing except a few mangy goats on their way to the\nsalt lick. …\nBut somehow, despite the dangers, Call had never felt pressed in quite the way he had\nlately, bound in by the small but constant needs of others. The physical work didn’t matter:\nCall was not one to sit on a porch all day, playing cards or gossiping. He intended to work;\nhe had just grown tired of always providing the example. He was still the Captain, but no\none had seemed to notice that there was no troop and no war. He had been in charge so\nlong that everyone assumed all thoughts, questions, needs, and wants had to be referred to\nhim, however simple these might be. The men couldn’t stop expecting him to [c]aptain, and\nhe couldn’t stop thinking he had to. It was ingrained2 in him, he had done it so long, but he\nwas aware that it wasn’t appropriate anymore. They weren’t even peace\nofficers: they just ran a livery stable, trading horses and cattle when they could find a buyer.\nThe work they did was mostly work he could do in his sleep, and yet, though his day-to-day\nresponsibilities had constantly shrunk over the last ten years, life did not seem easier. It just\nseemed smaller and a good deal more dull. …",

        "passage": "…We, the new explorers for the modern age, must rely to the fullest on the traditional\nexplorer’s greatest asset: the human intellect. Unlike any other species on Earth, human\nbeings have the ability to look back in time and to learn. We know the strengths of the great\nancient civilizations as well as the catastrophic mistakes that crumbled empires. It was the\ntraditional explorer who blazed a trail to this past. The new explorers—all of us—must use\nthat trail to find our way to the future, to chart our course, and our children’s course, into\nthe unknowns ahead.\nThe past age of the lone explorer, Boorstin1 wrote, opened at a time when medieval\ncartographers did not place “North” at the top of their maps. At the upper margins of their\nparchments they drew instead a mysterious spot they imagined in the east: paradise, which\nno living human had ever entered. Monks, looking for this garden “where Earth joins the\nsky,” became the first explorers; next, pilgrims wandered in search of the holy place; then\ncrusaders forged into new lands in the name of God; and finally, missionaries infiltrated\nfarther into Earth’s unknown corridors—all of them pushing back the boundaries of their\nworld in quest of paradise.\nOn one of my own voyages, I think I found it.\nCalypso was exploring the waters of the Aleutian Islands, in Alaska. We sailed into an\nunreal world—the sky, the ice, the water, all brushed by the indescribable light that makes\ndusk indistinguishable from dawn during the season of the midnight sun. After I dropped\nanchor off the island of Unalaska, our chief diver, Raymond Coll, climbed into our diving\nsaucer and took it down for a search under the surface of the sea. Raymond, who stayed in\ncontact with me by sonar telephone, described walruses and whales, vast pink fields of\nkrill—icy waters that brimmed with life.\nAbove, on board Calypso, the team was uncharacteristically preoccupied with another\nendeavor altogether. NASA had just landed a module on the moon, and the entire Calypso\ncrew crowded onto the fantail to listen raptly to the radio, awaiting the announcement that\na human being, Neil Armstrong, was about to step onto the lunar surface.\nExcitement electrified the atmosphere on board. We barely breathed. And then,\nArmstrong’s voice. A cheer rose from the deck and echoed in the crystal air. I switched on\nmy sonar link with Coll. “Raymond! Historic news! Armstrong is walking on the moon!”\nI felt a proud sense of fraternity that day with the NASA explorers who were reaching\ninto the distant corners of space even as our little team explored the depths of the sea. Yet\nI also felt a sense of privilege that had to do not with the astronauts, but with the wet, blue\nEarth on which they were gazing. Out in space, a human being stepped through dry lunar\ndust. But Raymond sailed through a myriad2 of life, undersea on the solar system’s only\nplanet awash with liquid water.\nSeveral years later, the astronaut Alan Bean spoke to me about his own space voyage.\nFrom the moon, he watched Earth spin through cycles of night and day. When the dark side\nof Earth faced him, our planet appeared to be encircled by a girdle of sparks. It took him\nquite some time to realize that these tiny glimmers were flashes of lightning from the\nquasi-permanent thunderstorms that ring the equator. He marveled: “The Earth looked like\na scintillating jewel.”\nAnd that it is—the very reason why searching for ways to safeguard Earth is such a\nnecessity and such a joy. After all, the road to paradise—as the Spanish proverb goes—is\nparadise.",

I pictured this voice as a hothouse plant, something\nluxuriant, with glossy foliage and the word tuberous in the name, and a musky scent at night.\nI made sure the voice was provided with the right temperature, the right degree of humidity,\nthe right ambience.1 I soothed its fears; I told it not to tremble. I nurtured it, I trained it, I\nwatched it climb up inside my neck like a vine.\nThe voice bloomed. People said I had grown into my voice. Soon I was sought after, or\nrather my voice was. We went everywhere together. What people saw was me, what I saw\nwas my voice, ballooning out in front of me like the translucent greenish membrane of a\nfrog in full trill.\nMy voice was courted. Bouquets were thrown to it. Money was bestowed on it. Men fell\non their knees before it. Applause flew around it like flocks of red birds.\nInvitations to perform cascaded over us. All the best places wanted us, and all at once,\nfor, as people said—though not to me—my voice would thrive only for a certain term. Then,\nas voices do, it would begin to shrivel. Finally it would drop off, and I would be left alone,\ndenuded—a dead shrub, a footnote.\nIt’s begun to happen, the shrivelling. Only I have noticed it so far. There’s the barest\npucker in my voice, the barest wrinkle. Fear has entered me, a needleful of ether,2\nconstricting what in someone else would be my heart.\nNow it’s evening; the neon lights come on, excitement quickens in the streets. We sit in\nthis hotel room, my voice and I; or rather in this hotel suite, because it’s still nothing but the\nbest for us. We’re gathering our strength together. How much of my life do I have left?\nLeftover, that is: my voice has used up most of it. I’ve given it all my love, but it’s only a\nvoice, it can never love me in return.\nAlthough it’s begun to decay, my voice is still as greedy as ever. Greedier: it wants more,\nmore and more, more of everything it’s had so far. It won’t let go of me easily.\nSoon it will be time for us to go out. We’ll attend a luminous occasion, the two of us,\nchained together as always. I’ll put on its favourite dress, its favourite necklace. I’ll wind a\nfur around it, to protect it from the drafts. Then we’ll descend to the foyer, glittering like\nice, my voice attached like an invisible vampire to my throat.",

        "passage": "Glenn Curtiss made his name as an aviator, but he started out his career as a record-\nsetting motorcyclist, reaching the mind-boggling and joint-rattling speed of 136 miles per\nhour in 1907. Later that year he joined Alexander Graham Bell and three other members\nof the Aerial Experiment Association to help create ailerons, hinged wing flaps that enable\nairplanes to bank and turn. Curtiss went on to make America’s first exhibition flight, win the\nfirst international air-speed prize at Reims, France, in 1909, and design the first practical\nseaplane.\nIn World War I he made millions with seaplanes and the Curtiss Jenny, a sturdy,\naffordable trainer that became the workhorse of barnstormers1 and airmail pilots after the\nwar. In 1917 he created the Curtiss Autoplane, an unsuccessful hybrid of airplane and car.\nIn the 1920s the “King of the Air” found that he hankered to get back to his lifelong\nloves of hunting, fishing, and camping. At 40, he wanted more comfort for his road trips, so\nhe decided to build his own travel trailer and create a new business to do so.\nThe timing seemed right. The Roaring Twenties saw Detroit’s automobile industry\nrunning full throttle; Americans flocked to the nation’s highways. With so few facilities on\nthe road, many long-distance drivers simply brought their own, sometimes by building\ntrailers for themselves. …\nCurtiss also designed his Aerocar [travel trailer] to free passengers from the tyranny of\nbad roads. In the words of his patent application, the occupants of normal vehicles “are\njolted and jostled about in a most objectionable manner; in fact, so much so that riding\nbecomes irksome, tiresome, and uncomfortable in the extreme.” That was not the case for\nAerocar passengers, who could lounge in fixed armchairs, enjoying close-set windows that\ncreated 10-foot fields of vision on both sides, broken only by window posts. An occupant\ncould also stretch out on the rear-facing divan in the prow, under a built-in Philco radio.\nA table snapped into place so that passengers might play cards or sit down to a meal\ncreated in the galley,2 with its two-burner gasoline stove, icebox, and sink. The chemical\ntoilet had its own private compartment.\nA privacy curtain turned the galley into a shower. (A drain in the linoleum took care of\nthe water.) Concealed Pullman-type bunks pulled down from the roof, while armchairs\nfolded down to make additional sleeping spaces. Snap-up privacy curtains and individual\nreading lights added further amenities.\nThe Aerocar’s $2,600 price tag clearly placed it in the luxury market, which made it\ndifficult to sell during the Depression. Nevertheless, sales of Aerocars managed to weather\nthe hard times, even surviving Curtiss’s unexpected death in 1930 at age 52. …\nIn the Depression year of 1936, the New York Times estimated that 100,000 trailers of\nall sorts were already on the road, while buyers were prepared to snap up another\n300,000—more than six times what the country’s estimated 300 manufacturers expected to\nproduce in a year. “A new industry is rapidly coming to the front,” the paper said. “It is not\nan uncommon sight these days to drive past a factory making trailers and find it operating\nfull blast in the middle of the night. Many plants are running twenty-four hours a day, seven\ndays a week.” At the National Automobile Show later that year, dealers displayed 50\ndifferent models, ranging in price from $275 to $12,000. …",

It was the biggest gift we’d ever tackled for Mama; up to that\npoint we’d been satisfied with the cross-stitch on burlap or the file-card holders or the black\nconstruction-paper silhouettes that Miss Zilch or Miss Drechsler or Mrs. Smith dreamed up\nto motivate us between Thanksgiving and Christmas. …\nWith our sister Mary’s help we filled out the form and sent it off with a money order\nprocured from the mailman by putting a “Please blow horn” sign in the mailbox. This had\nto be accomplished on Saturday, when Mama was gone to market. Then the vigil began.\nLet’s see—two days for the order to get to Chicago, a couple of days to process it, three or\nfour days coming back, and a Sunday in between. At the most it ought to come in nine days.\nEvery day we got out the catalogue and turned it to the dog-eared page where our\ntreasure was pictured. “What do you think of that, Mama?” asked Bill, with thinly disguised\nbraggadocio.1 “Wouldn’t you just love to have something like that around here?” Our\ntea set was as well kept a secret as a case of mumps.2\nAs good luck would have it, the package arrived two weeks to the day from when we\nordered. Saturday again, and Mama was at market, so we set the box on a chair and dived\nin with all six fists. Not a very big box for twenty-one pieces! But all the same, big enough\nto make quite some impression under the tree. …\nFirst the cream pitcher, then the sugar bowl. “The lid? … Oh, here.” Then the wondrous\nteapot—shimmering blue laced with a spray of pinkish-red blossoms. To our chagrin one of\nthe cups was a tissue-paper wad of broken pieces. Oh well, even a twenty-piece tea set was\nnot to be sneezed at. Maybe some adjustment could be made.\nWe counted them all, wrapping them again in the tissue and laboriously fitting them\nback in the excelsior,3 hastening to banish all traces before Mom got home. We wrapped\nthe box in two or three pieces of last year’s Christmas paper, closing the stubborn flaps with\nChristmas seals that came “free” in the mail. We adorned it royally with old ribbon untangled\nfrom the wad, and then hid it away in Mary’s closet. …\nI don’t really remember how she reacted. I’m sure it was a convincing show. It didn’t\noccur to us (as I’m sure it did to her) to wonder where in our crowded cupboard she was\ngoing to put twenty pieces of china “Made in Japan.”\nWe used the tea set from time to time and the pieces disappeared. The cream pitcher\nwent early in the game, then the six plates, the five cups, the saucers. The remnants moved\ngradually upward in the cupboard.\nWhen we went through Mama’s fifty-seven-year accumulation of “things,” way up in the\nrear of the top shelf of the kitchen cupboard we unearthed the lid to a sugar bowl long gone\nand the blue luster teapot. Its spout was held on precariously with Scotch tape; no tea had\npoured from it for years. But too precious, obviously, to discard were the fragments of\na Christmas memory more cherished than the gift had ever been.",

        "passage": "If there is a universal in the Falkland Islands, it is the wind. Blowing in from the\nSouthern Ocean, born in distant Antarctica and pregnant with drizzle, it scythes across this\ntreeless, grassy archipelago more than 300 miles off the coast of Argentina. At times it blows\na furious gale against which one can barely walk; at other times it’s a brisk breeze that merely\nrips the cap from your head. In just a couple of days I’d already grown accustomed to its\nendless keen and sharp edge, but what stopped me short this time was something new and\nbaffling—the way the wind seemed to make the ground itself shimmer, like rippling water.\nLooking closer, I realized the ripples were trillions of tiny feathers blanketing the\nground in an even white layer and piled up in ankle-deep drifts wherever there was a gully\nor depression. Taking a few more steps I topped a small rise—and discovered the answer to\nthe mystery.\nThousands of gentoo penguins—three feet tall, attired in classic penguin monochrome1\nbut with white caps—stood around a small and shrinking pond, digging their orange beaks\ndeep into the molting feathers of their backs and sides. The wind picked up fresh squalls of\ndown, blowing them across the dunes and toward a nearby beach, where hundreds more\npenguins hurried back and forth between the colony and the ocean surf, waddling along on\nthick, tangerine feet. …\nHaving disregarded me to this point, the gentoos suddenly decided I was the most\ninteresting thing in the colony. Immediately scores of them started plodding my way, necks\noutstretched with lively curiosity, tripping over one another in their haste. They jammed\naround within a foot or so of me, bobbing their heads and making small, murmuring sounds;\nI was lying so low that I found myself looking up at them. A few pecked inquisitively at my\nrain pants, while one leaned down and peered into the barrel of my telephoto lens, staring,\nit seemed, at its reflection. They constantly shook their heads with quick, sharp snaps to\ndislodge the droplets of highly saline water that drip endlessly from the tips of their bills.\nThis is how penguins void excess salt from the water they drink. But it gave me the\ndisquieting sense of general disapproval from a crowd too polite to actually say so.\nI was on Sea Lion Island, the most southerly of the more than 700 islands that make up\nthe Falklands—a world a naturalist could spend a lifetime exploring, from craggy inland\npeaks and flower-spangled marshes to isolated rocky outcrops surrounded by lush kelp forests\nteeming with fur seals and porpoises. For a week I would hopscotch among the outer\nislands on the government air-taxi service (the only way to reach most of the archipelago),\nvisiting some of the places that have made the Falklands a grail2 destination of mine for\ndecades: huge colonies where five species of penguins can be found; wetlands crowded with\nwaterfowl few birders have even heard of; remote bays where strange raptors try to steal the\nhat off your head; and nature reserves where elephant seals and sea lions treat you like just\nanother member of the herd.\nAll of which was marvelous, but—typical of the way that the Falklands defy all\nexpectations—the most unforgettable moments came unexpectedly at the very end, not on\nsome far-flung shore but on a small islet just a short boat ride from Stanley, the capital.\nThere we stepped back into an older, wilder world—like Eden before the fall, where the\nmaniacal laughter of thousands of birds fills the dark, and where roaring sea lions lie\nhidden within a jungle of grasses. The Falklands, I was quickly learning, are truly one of\nthe most remarkable places on earth. …",

        "passage": "…In summer the highways are dissolved into three wild rivers—the River of Rocks,\nwhich issues from the hills; the River of Meadows, which flows from the great lake; and the\nRiver of the Way Out, which runs down from their meeting-place to the settlements and\nthe little world. But in winter, when the ice is firm under the snow, and the going is fine,\nthere are no tracks upon the three broad roads except the paths of the caribou, and the\nfootprints of the marten and the mink and the fox, and the narrow trails made by Luke\nDubois on his way to and from his cabin by the rivers.\nHe leaned in the door-way, looking out. Behind him in the shadow, the fire was still\nsnapping in the little stove where he had cooked his breakfast. There was a comforting smell\nof bacon and venison in the room; the tea-pot stood on the table half-empty. Here in the\ncorner were his rifle and some of his traps. On the wall hung his snowshoes. Under the bunk\nwas a pile of skins. Half-open on the bench lay the book that he had been reading the\nevening before, while the snow was falling. It was a book of veritable1 fairy-tales, which told\nhow men had made their way in the world, and achieved great fortunes, and won success,\nby toiling hard at first, and then by trading and bargaining and getting ahead of other men.\n“Well,” said Luke, to himself, as he stood at the door, “I could do that too. Without\ndoubt I also am one of the men who can do things. They did not work any harder than I do.\nBut they got better pay. I am twenty-five. For ten years I have worked hard, and what have\nI got for it? This!”\nHe stepped out into the morning, alert and vigorous, deep-chested and straight-hipped.\nThe strength of the hills had gone into him, and his eyes were bright with health. His\nkingdom was spread before him. There along the River of Meadows were the haunts2 of the\nmoose and the caribou where he hunted in the fall; and yonder on the burnt hills around\nthe great lake were the places where he watched for the bears; and up beside the River of\nRocks ran his line of traps, swinging back by secret ways to many a nameless pond and\nhidden beaver-meadow; and all along the streams, when the ice went out in the spring, the\ngreat trout would be leaping in rapid and pool. Among the peaks and valleys of that\nforest-clad kingdom he could find his way as easily as a merchant walks from his house to\nhis office. The secrets of bird and beast were known to him; every season of the year\nbrought him its own tribute;3 the woods were his domain, vast, inexhaustible, free. …\nHis hand-sledge4 stood beside the door, and against it leaned the axe. He caught it up\nand began to split wood for the stove. “No!” he cried, throwing down the axe, “I’m tired of\nthis. It has lasted long enough. I’m going out to make my way in the world.”\nA couple of hours later, the sledge was packed with camp-gear and bundles of skins. The\ndoor of the cabin was shut; a ghostlike wreath of blue smoke curled from the chimney. Luke\nstood, in his snowshoes, on the white surface of the River of the Way Out. He turned to look\nback for a moment, and waved his hand.\n“Good-bye, old cabin! Good-bye, the rivers! Good-bye, the woods!”",

        "passage": "On the roof of a speeding freight train, a slender woman in a white feather cap and long\nnarrow skirt sits crumpled, cradling her head. Her day’s work is done. A minute ago, she\nleaped onto this train from a towering overpass, pointing out two stowaway thieves to the\nengineers on duty. As they race to nab the bandits, she doubles over to catch her breath.\nThe men, she knows, can take it from here.\nSuddenly, one of the thieves appears on the roof. Fresh from a fistfight with the\nconductors, the thug tries to rush past her. She scrambles to her feet and lunges at his waist.\nThey wrestle. He tries to shake her. She tackles him, and in an instant, the two are pitched\nover the side into the river below. As they wade from the water, the wet hat still clinging to\nher head, she sacks him again, delivering a taste of justice. …\nHelen Holmes, the scrappy 20-year-old featured in The Hazards of Helen, wasn’t the\nmost famous or the most glamorous. But with the women’s suffrage movement reaching a\nfever pitch, her no-nonsense handling of everyday affairs in a man’s world turned her into\na fan favorite. What made her truly revolutionary—even as she faded into obscurity with the\nrest of the silent film stars—was what she did behind the scenes.\nA Chicago-raised tomboy-turned-model, Holmes was more than just the star of\nThe Hazards of Helen—she was, in large part, its creator. Holmes landed her first film roles\nin silent comedies in 1912. Shortly after, she joined forces, personally and professionally,\nwith J.P. “Jack” McGowan, an Australian director who specialized in short action films. He\ndirected her in more than 20 flicks—most of them one- or two-reel railroad dramas. …\n“If a photoplay actress wants to achieve real thrills, she must write them into the\nscenario herself,” she once said. “[N]early all scenario writers and authors for the films are\nmen, and men usually won’t provide for a girl things they wouldn’t do themselves. So if I\nwant really thrilly action, I ask permission to write it myself.”\nEach weekly installment found Helen facing fresh danger—from thieves to runaway\ntrains. In The Wild Engine (1915) Helen got a job at a railroad, only to have the\nsuperintendent of the company berate the underling who hired her. “Women cannot use\ntheir heads in case of emergency, and if you employ her, I shall hold you entirely responsible!”\nSuffice to say, an emergency soon tests his theory. When an engine goes haywire and sets\non a collision course with a passenger train, Helen jumps on a motorcycle and zooms off to\nstop it. She keeps the trains from colliding, of course, but she also rides the motorcycle off\na bridge and into a river to enhance the action. The film ends with the superintendent\nchanging his stance on Helen’s hiring—a simplistic story, simplistically told, but one that\npresents a radical message by 1915 standards.\nIn the pre-Hollywood days of early cinema, moviemaking was defined by a\nrough-and-tumble DIY [Do It Yourself] aesthetic. Unlike many of her colleagues, Holmes\nperformed many death-defying stunts herself, from swinging onto moving locomotives to\ncrawling across the hoods of speeding cars. She moved with the grace of an athlete. Asked\nabout her stunt work, she remarked that she sought to perform stunts without losing “that\nair of femininity of which we are all so proud. But by that I do not mean the frail side of\nwoman. I mean the heroic side.” …",
