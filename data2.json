        "passage": "It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat\nearlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The\nlandlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor\nmy coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance1 of mankind I rang the bell and gave\na curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted\nto while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of\nthe articles had a pencil-mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through\nit. …\n“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the possibility of an\nAtlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great\nchain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other\narts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and\npatient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible\nperfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which\npresent the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history\nof the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile2 as such an exercise\nmay seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what\nto look for. By a man’s fingernails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser-knees, by\nthe callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt-cuffs—by each of\nthese things a man’s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the\ncompetent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”\n“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table; “I never\nread such rubbish in my life.”\n“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\n“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg-spoon as I sat down to my\nbreakfast. “I see that you have read it, since you have marked it. I don’t deny that it is smartly\nwritten. It irritates me, though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\nevolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical.\nI should like to see him clapped down in a third-class carriage on the Underground and\nasked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\nhim.”\n“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked, calmly. “As for the article,\nI wrote it myself.”\n“You?”\n“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have\nexpressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical, are really extremely\npractical—so practical that I depend upon them for my bread-and-cheese.”\n“And how?” I asked, involuntarily.\n“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I’m a\nconsulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of\ngovernment detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come\nto me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me,\nand I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them\nstraight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details\nof a thousand at your finger-ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first.\nLestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case,\nand that was what brought him here.”\n“And these other people?”\n“They are mostly sent out by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in\ntrouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to\nmy comments, and then I pocket my fee.”\n“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you can unravel\nsome knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for\nthemselves?”\n“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a\nlittle more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see,\nI have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\nwonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn\nare invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared\nto be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”\n“You were told, no doubt.”\n“Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of\nthought ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion without being\nconscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning\nran: ‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an\narmy doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the\nnatural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as\nhis haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and\nunnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much\nhardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did\nnot occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were\nastonished.” …\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the\ntopic.\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly dressed\nindividual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the\nnumbers. He had a large, blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\nmessage.\n“You mean the retired sergeant of marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify his guess.”\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching\ncaught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a\nloud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the\nletter.\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when\nhe made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I said, blandly, “what your trade may be?”\n“Commissionnaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.”\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.",

        "passage": "Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge. Its goal is to find\nout how the world works, to seek what regularities there may be, to penetrate to the\nconnections of things—from subnuclear particles, which may be the constituents of all\nmatter, to living organisms, the human social community, and thence to the cosmos as a\nwhole. Our intuition is by no means an infallible guide. Our perceptions may be distorted\nby training and prejudice or merely because of the limitations of our sense organs, which,\nof course, perceive directly but a small fraction of the phenomena of the world. Even so\nstraightforward a question as whether in the absence of friction a pound of lead falls faster\nthan a gram of fluff was answered incorrectly by Aristotle and almost everyone else before\nthe time of Galileo. Science is based on experiment, on a willingness to challenge old\ndogma, on an openness to see the universe as it really is. Accordingly, science sometimes\nrequires courage—at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom.\nBeyond this the main trick of science is to really think of something: the shape of clouds\nand their occasional sharp bottom edges at the same altitude everywhere in the sky; the\nformation of a dewdrop on a leaf; the origin of a name or a word—Shakespeare, say, or\n“philanthropic”; the reason for human social customs—the incest taboo, for example; how\nit is that a lens in sunlight can make paper burn; how a “walking stick” got to look so much\nlike a twig; why the Moon seems to follow us as we walk; what prevents us from digging a\nhole down to the center of the Earth; what the definition is of “down” on a spherical Earth;\nhow it is possible for the body to convert yesterday’s lunch into today’s muscle and sinew;\nor how far is up—does the universe go on forever, or if it does not, is there any meaning to\nthe question of what lies on the other side? Some of these questions are pretty easy. Others,\nespecially the last, are mysteries to which no one even today knows the answer. They are\nnatural questions to ask. Every culture has posed such questions in one way or another.\nAlmost always the proposed answers are in the nature of “Just So Stories,” attempted\nexplanations divorced from experiment, or even from careful comparative observations.\nBut the scientific cast of mind examines the world critically as if many alternative worlds\nmight exist, as if other things might be here which are not. Then we are forced to ask why\nwhat we see is present and not something else. Why are the Sun and the Moon and the\nplanets spheres? Why not pyramids, or cubes, or dodecahedra? Why not irregular, jumbly\nshapes? Why so symmetrical, worlds? If you spend any time spinning hypotheses, checking\nto see whether they make sense, whether they conform to what else we know, thinking of\ntests you can pose to substantiate or deflate your hypotheses, you will find yourself doing\nscience. And as you come to practice this habit of thought more and more you will get\nbetter and better at it. To penetrate into the heart of the thing—even a little thing, a blade\nof grass, as Walt Whitman said—is to experience a kind of exhilaration that, it may be, only\nhuman beings of all the beings on this planet can feel. We are an intelligent species and the\nuse of our intelligence quite properly gives us pleasure. In this respect the brain is like a\nmuscle. When we think well, we feel good. Understanding is a kind of ecstasy. …\nLet us approach a much more modest question: not whether we can know the universe\nor the Milky Way Galaxy or a star or a world. Can we know, ultimately and in detail, a grain\nof salt? Consider one microgram of table salt, a speck just barely large enough for someone\nwith keen eyesight to make out without a microscope. In that grain of salt there are about\n1016 sodium and chlorine atoms. This is a 1 followed by 16 zeros, 10 million billion atoms.\nIf we wish to know a grain of salt, we must know at least the three-dimensional positions of\neach of these atoms. (In fact, there is much more to be known—for example, the nature of\nthe forces between the atoms—but we are making only a modest calculation.) Now, is this\nnumber more or less than the number of things which the brain can know?\nHow much can the brain know? There are perhaps 1011 neurons in the brain, the\ncircuit elements and switches that are responsible in their electrical and chemical activity\nfor the functioning of our minds. A typical brain neuron has perhaps a thousand little wires,\ncalled dendrites, which connect it with its fellows. If, as seems likely, every bit of information\nin the brain corresponds to one of these connections, the total number of things knowable\nby the brain is no more than 1014, one hundred trillion. But this number is only one\npercent of the number of atoms in our speck of salt.\nSo in this sense the universe is intractable,1 astonishingly immune to any human\nattempt at full knowledge. We cannot on this level understand a grain of salt, much less the\nuniverse.\nBut let us look a little more deeply at our microgram of salt. Salt happens to be a\ncrystal in which, except for defects in the structure of the crystal lattice, the position of\nevery sodium and chlorine atom is predetermined. If we could shrink ourselves into this\ncrystalline world, we would see rank upon rank of atoms in an ordered array, a regularly\nalternating structure—sodium, chlorine, sodium, chlorine specifying the sheet of atoms we\nare standing on and all the sheets above us and below us. An absolutely pure crystal of salt\ncould have the position of every atom specified by something like 10 bits of information.2\nThis would not strain the information-carrying capacity of the brain.\nIf the universe had natural laws that governed its behavior to the same degree of\nregularity that determines a crystal of salt, then, of course, the universe would be knowable.\nEven if there were many such laws, each of considerable complexity, human beings might\nhave the capability to understand them all. Even if such knowledge exceeded the information-\ncarrying capacity of the brain, we might store the additional information outside our\nbodies—in books, for example, or in computer memories—and still, in some sense, know\nthe universe. …",

        "passage": "Against the clamor of the city, who could hear the prayers being uttered in Peace Lane?\nWho would notice people whose dearest wish in life is not to be praised for merit but only\nto avoid making mistakes? Here a lean-to shed has been added on to the terrace and the\ncourtyard roofed over to make a kitchen. If you were to look down upon the rooftops of the\ncity, you would find them in utter disarray, worn and dilapidated, structures built on top of\nstructures, taking up every bit of free space. This was especially true of the older longtang,\nlike Peace Lane—it’s a miracle that they haven’t collapsed yet. About a third of the tiles\nwere broken, patched over in places with bits of felt, the wooden frames on the doors and\nwindows were blackened and rotting, with everything in view a uniform ash gray.\nBut though it was falling apart on the outside, the spirit of the place remained; its inner\nvoice, though stifled, was still audible. But amid all the noises of this city, just what did this\nvoice amount to? There was never a moment of peace and quiet in the city; the day had its\nsounds, as did the night, and between them they drowned that voice out. But it was still\nthere—it couldn’t be silenced because it was the foundation upon which the hubbub and\ncommotion fed; without it all of those noises would have been nothing but an empty echo.\nBut what did this voice say? Two words: to live. No matter how loud the noise became, no\nmatter what a rumpus it made, or how long it carried on, it could never find those two\nwords. Those two little words weighed a ton, so they sank, and sank—all the way down, to\nthe very bottom; only immaterial things like smoke and mist could float up to the surface.\nIt was impossible to listen to this voice without crying. The prayers whispered in Peace\nLane went on day and night, like an ever-burning alter [sic] lamp, but they weren’t burning\non oil: inch by inch, they were burning thoughts. In contrast, the chaotic noises echoing in\nthe city’s air were nothing but the scraps and leftovers of life, which is why they could be so\nliberally strewn about. The prayers concealed throughout those thousands of Shanghai\nlongtang rang out louder and clearer than all the church bells in Europe: they created a\nrumbling thunder that seemed to emerge from the earth itself, the sound of mountains\ncrumbling. A shame we had no way of participating in this ourselves, but just looking at the\nabyss they created was enough to make the heart grow cold. See what they have done to this\nplace! It is hard to say whether this was a form of construction or destruction, but whatever\nit was, it was massive.\nWhat Peace Lane prayed for was peace itself. You could hear it even from the bell that\nwas rung every night to warn people to mind their kitchen fires. Peace is not something\nordinary, but Peace Lane had an ordinary heart and its prayers were quite humble as well;\nthese modest requests, however, were not easily granted. No major disaster had befallen\nPeace Lane in many years, but little things kept coming up, such as someone falling off the\nbalcony while bringing in their laundry, another getting electrocuted when he turned off a\nlight switch with a wet hand, pressure cooker explosions, rat poison accidentally ingested.\nIf all these, who died wrongful deaths, had cried out, their howls would have been deafening.\nSo how could one not pray for peace and security?\nIn the early evening, when the lights came on, you could see in all the windows the\nwatchful eyes of frightened people looking out for signs of trouble. But whenever something\nbad did happen, no one ever saw it coming. This was where Peace Lane had gone numb\nand where it displayed its pragmatism. The residents were never prepared for the closest\ndangers. Yes, they understood the dangers of fire and electricity, but beyond that they had\nno imagination. And so if you were to see the people of Peace Lane praying, they would be\nlike idiots reciting a book from memory, chanting with their lips but not their minds,\nrepeating the same incantations over and over again. Meanwhile the flowerpot\nsitting on the windowsill was just an inch away from falling down, but no one ever bothered\nto move it; the termites had already done their work on the floors, but no one ever seemed\nto care; illegal structures kept being added one on top of the other, causing the foundation\nto sink, yet another one was about to be built. During the typhoon season, when Peace Lane\nshook and rattled and it appeared as if the entire neighborhood was going to pieces, people\ncurled up in their rooms, complacently enjoying the cool breeze brought by the storm.\nWhat people in Peace Lane prayed for was to be able to live in a fool’s paradise—they would\nrather turn a blind eye and never ask questions. The pigeon whistles sounding in the\nmorning sang of peace, announcing the good but never the bad; but even if they had, would\nthat have made a difference? You might be able to escape it in the first round, but would\nyou escape in the second? Put that way, those prayers must imply an acceptance, a sort of\nDaoist resignation to reality. For want of anything else to pray for, night after night they\npray for peace, but that was just wishful thinking. ...\nBut now the story seems to be coming to an end. Even those who attempt brazen acts\nwith a smiling façade are met with sober, straight faces: the time for equivocation was over.\nThe tide was receding and the rocks would soon be exposed. Counting on one’s fingers, one\nfinds that the Shanghai longtang have quite a few years on them—a few more and they’ll\nbe treading on thin ice. Going up again to the highest point in the city and looking down,\none sees that the crisscrossing longtang neighborhoods are already beginning to look\ndesolate. If these had been large imposing building[s], that desolation might be mitigated\nby their grand proportions. But longtang buildings all have low walls and narrow courtyards,\nfilled with ordinary people carrying out their mundane tasks: could places like these be\nthought of as desolate? Desolation takes on a comical aspect in such places, and that only\nmakes the people living there all the more dejected. Putting it in harsher terms: the whole\nplace bore a certain resemblance to a heap of rubble. With the leaves falling in early\nwinter, all we see are broken bricks and shattered tiles. Like an aging beauty who retains\nher alluring profile, it can no longer bear scrutiny. Should you insist on searching for a trace\nof her former charm—after all, not everything is erased—you would have to look for it in\nthe turn of the alley. Left here, right there, as if glancing coquettishly from side to side, but\nthe eyes that are so flirtatious are also getting on in years, they have lost their luster and are\nincapable of grabbing hold of your attention. Soon, sleet began to come down—that was the\nfrigid past accumulated over generations—turning to water before it even hit the ground. ...",

        "passage": "...Brother, the business on which we are now come is to restore the friendship that has\nexisted between the United States and the Six Nations, agreeably to the direction of the\ncommissioner from the fifteen fires of the United States. He assured us that whensoever,\nby any grievances, the chain of friendship should become rusty, we might have it brightened\nby calling on you. We dispense with the usual formality of having your speech again read,\nas we fully comprehended it yesterday, and it would therefore be useless to waste time in a\nrepetition of it.\nBrother, yesterday you wiped the tears from our eyes, that we might see clearly; you\nunstopped our ears that we might hear; and removed the obstructions from our throats that\nwe might speak distinctly. You offered to join with us in tearing up the largest pine-tree in\nour forests, and under it to bury the tomahawk. We gladly join with you, brother, in this\nwork, and let us heap rocks and stones on the root of this tree that the tomahawk may never\nagain be found. ...\nBrother, we observe that the men now in office are new men, and, we fear, not fully\ninformed of all that has befallen us. In 1791 a treaty was held by the commissioners of\nCongress with us at Tioga Point, on a similar occasion. We have lost seven of our warriors,\nmurdered in cold blood by white men, since the conclusion of the war. We are tired of this\nmighty grievance and wish some general arrangement to prevent it in future. The first of\nthese was murdered on the banks of the Ohio, near Fort Pitt. Shortly after two men\nbelonging to our first families were murdered at Pine Creek; then one at Fort Franklin;\nanother at Tioga Point; and now the two that occasion this visit, on the Big Beaver. These\nlast two had families. The one was a Seneca; the other a Tuscarora. Their families are now\ndestitute of support, and we think that the United States should do something toward their\nsupport, as it is to the United States they owe the loss of their heads.\nBrother, these offences are always committed in one place on the frontier of\nPennsylvania. In the Genesee country we live happy and no one molests us. I must\ntherefore beg that the President will exert all his influence with all officers, civil and\nmilitary, in that quarter, to remedy this grievance, and trust that he will thus prevent a\nrepetition of it and save our blood from being spilled in future.\nBrother, let me call to mind the treaty between the United States and the Six Nations,\nconcluded at Canandaigua. At that treaty Colonel Pickering, who was commissioner on\nbehalf of the United States, agreed that the United States should pay to the Six Nations four\nthousand five hundred dollars per annum, and that this should pass through the hands of\nthe superintendent of the United States, to be appointed for that purpose. This treaty was\nmade in the name of the President of the United States, who was then General Washington;\nand, as he is now no more, perhaps the present President would wish to renew the treaty.\nBut if he should think the old one valid and is willing to let it remain in force we are also\nwilling. The sum above mentioned we wish to have part of in money, to expend in more\nagricultural tools and in purchasing a team, as we have some horses that will do for the\npurpose. We also wish to build a sawmill on the Buffalo creek. If the President, however,\nthinks proper to have it continue as heretofore, we shall not be very uneasy. Whatever he\nmay do we agree to; we only suggest this for his consideration.\nBrother, I hand you the above-mentioned treaty, made by Colonel Pickering, in the\nname of General Washington, and the belt that accompanied it; as he is now dead we know\nnot if it is still valid. If not, we wish it renewed—if it is, we wish it copied on clean parchment.\nOur money got loose in our trunk and tore it. We also show you the belt which is the path\nof peace between our Six Nations and the United States. ...\nBrother, the business that has caused this our long journey was occasioned by some of\nyour bad men; the expense of it has been heavy on us. We beg that as so great a breach has\nbeen made on your part, the President will judge it proper that the United States should\nbear our expenses to and from home and whilst here.\nBrother, three horses belonging to the Tuscarora Nation were killed by some men under\nthe command of Major Rivardi, on the plains of Niagara. They have made application to the\nsuperintendent and to Major Rivardi, but get no redress. You make us pay for our breaches\nof the peace, why should you not pay also? A white man has told us the horses were killed\nby Major Rivardi’s orders, who said they should not be permitted to come there, although\nit was an open common on which they were killed. Mr. Chapin has the papers respecting\nthese horses, which we request you to take into consideration.",

        "passage": "Nine years ago Pyotr Sergeyitch, the deputy prosecutor, and I were riding towards\nevening in haymaking time to fetch the letters from the station.\nThe weather was magnificent, but on our way back we heard a peal of thunder, and saw\nan angry black storm-cloud which was coming straight towards us. The storm-cloud was\napproaching us and we were approaching it. …\nThen the first wave raced through the rye and a field of oats, there was a gust of wind,\nand the dust flew round and round in the air. Pyotr Sergeyitch laughed and spurred on his horse.\n“It’s fine!” he cried, “it’s splendid!”\nInfected by his gaiety, I too began laughing at the thought that in a minute I should be\ndrenched to the skin and might be struck by lightning.\nRiding swiftly in a hurricane when one is breathless with the wind, and feels like a bird,\nthrills one and puts one’s heart in a flutter. By the time we rode into our courtyard the wind\nhad gone down, and big drops of rain were pattering on the grass and on the roofs. There\nwas not a soul near the stable. …\n“What a crash!” said Pyotr Sergeyitch, coming up to me after a very loud rolling peal of\nthunder when it seemed as though the sky were split in two. “What do you say to that?”\nHe stood beside me in the doorway and, still breathless from his rapid ride, looked at\nme. I could see that he was admiring me.\n“Natalya Vladimirovna,” he said, “I would give anything only to stay here a little longer\nand look at you. You are lovely to-day.”\nHis eyes looked at me with delight and supplication, his face was pale. On his beard\nand moustache were glittering raindrops, and they, too, seemed to be looking at me\nwith love.\n“I love you,” he said. “I love you, and I am happy at seeing you. I know you cannot be\nmy wife, but I want nothing, I ask nothing; only know that I love you. Be silent, do not\nanswer me, take no notice of it, but only know that you are dear to me and let me look at\nyou.” …\n“You say nothing, and that is splendid,” said Pyotr Sergeyitch. “Go on being silent.”\nI felt happy. I laughed with delight and ran through the drenching rain to the house;\nhe laughed too, and, leaping as he went, ran after me.\nBoth drenched, panting, noisily clattering up the stairs like children, we dashed into the\nroom. My father and brother, who were not used to seeing me laughing and lighthearted,\nlooked at me in surprise and began laughing too. …\nWhen I went to bed I lighted a candle and threw my window wide open, and an\nundefined feeling took possession of my soul. I remembered that I was free and healthy,\nthat I had rank and wealth, that I was beloved; above all, that I had rank and wealth, rank\nand wealth, my God! how nice that was!… Then, huddling up in bed at a touch of cold\nwhich reached me from the garden with the dew, I tried to discover whether I loved Pyotr\nSergeyitch or not,… and fell asleep unable to reach any conclusion. …\nAnd what happened afterwards? Why—nothing. In the winter when we lived in town\nPyotr Sergeyitch came to see us from time to time. Country acquaintances are charming\nonly in the country and in summer; in the town and in winter they lose their charm. When\nyou pour out tea for them in the town it seems as though they are wearing other people’s\ncoats, and as though they stirred their tea too long. In the town, too, Pyotr Sergeyitch spoke\nsometimes of love, but the effect was not at all the same as in the country. In the town we\nwere more vividly conscious of the wall that stood between us: I had rank and wealth, while\nhe was poor, and he was not even a nobleman, but only the son of a deacon and a deputy\npublic prosecutor; we both of us—I through my youth and he for some unknown reason—\nthought of that wall as very high and thick, and when he was with us in the town he would\ncriticize aristocratic society with a forced smile, and maintain a sullen silence when there\nwas anyone else in the drawing-room. There is no wall that cannot be broken through, but\nthe heroes of the modern romance, so far as I know them, are too timid, spiritless, lazy, and\noversensitive, and are too ready to resign themselves to the thought that they are doomed\nto failure, that personal life has disappointed them; instead of struggling they merely\ncriticize, calling the world vulgar and forgetting that their criticism passes little by little into\nvulgarity.\nI was loved, happiness was not far away, and seemed to be almost touching me; I went\non living in careless ease without trying to understand myself, not knowing what I expected\nor what I wanted from life, and time went on and on.… People passed by me with their\nlove, bright days and warm nights flashed by, the nightingales sang, the hay smelt fragrant,\nand all this, sweet and overwhelming in remembrance, passed with me as with everyone\nrapidly, leaving no trace, was not prized, and vanished like mist.… Where is it all?\nMy father is dead, I have grown older; everything that delighted me, caressed me, gave me\nhope—the patter of the rain, the rolling of the thunder, thoughts of happiness, talk of\nlove—all that has become nothing but a memory, and I see before me a flat desert distance;\non the plain not one living soul, and out there on the horizon it is dark and terrible. …\nA ring at the bell.… It is Pyotr Sergeyitch. When in the winter I see the trees and\nremember how green they were for me in the summer I whisper:\n“Oh, my darlings!”\nAnd when I see people with whom I spent my spring-time, I feel sorrowful and warm\nand whisper the same thing. …\nNot knowing what to say I ask him:\n“Well, what have you to tell me?”\n“Nothing,” he answers. …\nI thought of the past, and all at once my shoulders began quivering, my head dropped,\nand I began weeping bitterly. I felt unbearably sorry for myself and for this man, and\npassionately longed for what had passed away and what life refused us now. And now I did\nnot think about rank and wealth.\nI broke into loud sobs, pressing my temples, and muttered:\n“My God! my God! my life is wasted!”\nAnd he sat and was silent, and did not say to me: “Don’t weep.” He understood that I\nmust weep, and that the time for this had come. …",

        "passage": "A few years ago the City Council of Monza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping\ngoldfish in curved fishbowls. The sponsors of the measure explained that it is cruel to keep\na fish in a bowl because the curved sides give the fish a distorted view of reality. Aside from\nthe measure’s significance to the poor goldfish, the story raises an interesting philosophical\nquestion: How do we know that the reality we perceive is true?\nThe goldfish is seeing a version of reality that is different from ours, but can we be sure\nit is any less real? For all we know, we, too, may spend our entire lives staring out at the\nworld through a distorting lens.\nIn physics, the question is not academic. Indeed, physicists and cosmologists are\nfinding themselves in a similar predicament to the goldfish’s. For decades we have strived\nto come up with an ultimate theory of everything—one complete and consistent set of\nfundamental laws of nature that explain every aspect of reality. It now appears that this\nquest may yield not a single theory but a family of interconnected theories, each describing\nits own version of reality, as if it viewed the universe through its own fishbowl.\nThis notion may be difficult for many people, including some working scientists, to\naccept. Most people believe that there is an objective reality out there and that our senses\nand our science directly convey information about the material world. Classical science is\nbased on the belief that an external world exists whose properties are definite and inde-\npendent of the observer who perceives them. In philosophy, that belief is called realism. …\nThe idea of alternative realities is a mainstay of today’s popular culture. For example,\nin the science-fiction film The Matrix the human race is unknowingly living in a simulated\nvirtual reality created by intelligent computers to keep them pacified and content while the\ncomputers suck their bioelectrical energy (whatever that is). How do we know we are not\njust computer-generated characters living in a Matrix-like world? If we lived in a synthetic,\nimaginary world, events would not necessarily have any logic or consistency or obey any\nlaws. The aliens in control might find it more interesting or amusing to see our reactions,\nfor example, if everyone in the world suddenly decided that chocolate was repulsive or that\nwar was not an option, but that has never happened. If the aliens did enforce consistent\nlaws, we would have no way to tell that another reality stood behind the simulated one. It\nis easy to call the world the aliens live in the “real” one and the computer-generated world\na false one. But if—like us—the beings in the simulated world could not gaze into their\nuniverse from the outside, they would have no reason to doubt their own pictures of reality.\nThe goldfish are in a similar situation. Their view is not the same as ours from outside\ntheir curved bowl, but they could still formulate scientific laws governing the motion of the\nobjects they observe on the outside. For instance, because light bends as it travels from air\nto water, a freely moving object that we would observe to move in a straight line would be\nobserved by the goldfish to move along a curved path. The goldfish could formulate\nscientific laws from their distorted frame of reference that would always hold true and that\nwould enable them to make predictions about the future motion of objects outside the\nbowl. Their laws would be more complicated than the laws in our frame, but simplicity is a\nmatter of taste. If the goldfish formulated such a theory, we would have to admit the\ngoldfish’s view as a valid picture of reality. …\nIn the quest to discover the ultimate laws of physics, no approach has raised higher\nhopes—or more controversy—than string theory. String theory was first proposed in the\n1970s as an attempt to unify all the forces of nature into one coherent framework and, \nin particular, to bring the force of gravity into the domain of quantum physics. By the early\n1990s, however, physicists discovered that string theory suffers from an awkward issue:\nthere are five different string theories. For those advocating that string theory was the\nunique theory of everything, this was quite an embarrassment. In the mid-1990s\nresearchers started discovering that these different theories—and yet another theory called\nsupergravity—actually describe the same phenomena, giving them some hope that they\nwould amount eventually to a unified theory. The theories are indeed related by what\nphysicists call dualities, which are a kind of mathematical dictionaries for translating\nconcepts back and forth. But, alas, each theory is a good description of phenomena only\nunder a certain range of conditions—for example at low energies. None can describe every\naspect of the universe.\nString theorists are now convinced that the five different string theories are just\ndifferent approximations to a more fundamental theory called M-theory. (No one seems to\nknow what the “M” stands for. It may be “master,” “miracle” or “mystery,” or all three.)\nPeople are still trying to decipher the nature of M-theory, but it seems that the traditional\nexpectation of a single theory of nature may be untenable and that to describe the universe\nwe must employ different theories in different situations. Thus, M-theory is not a theory in\nthe usual sense but a network of theories. It is a bit like a map. To faithfully represent the\nentire Earth on a flat surface, one has to use a collection of maps, each of which covers\na limited region. The maps overlap one another, and where they do, they show the same\nlandscape. Similarly, the different theories in the M-theory family may look very different,\nbut they can all be regarded as versions of the same underlying theory, and they all predict\nthe same phenomena where they overlap, but none works well in all situations.\nWhenever we develop a model of the world and find it to be successful, we tend to\nattribute to the model the quality of reality or absolute truth. But M-theory, like the\ngoldfish example, shows that the same physical situation can be modeled in different ways,\neach employing different fundamental elements and concepts. It might be that to describe\nthe universe we have to employ different theories in different situations. Each theory may\nhave its own version of reality, but according to model-dependent realism, that diversity is\nacceptable, and none of the versions can be said to be more real than any other. It is not the\nphysicist’s traditional expectation for a theory of nature, nor does it correspond to our\neveryday idea of reality. But it might be the way of the universe.",

        "passage": "It was generally agreed in New York that the Countess Olenska had “lost her looks.”\nShe had appeared there first, in Newland Archer’s boyhood, as a brilliantly pretty little\ngirl of nine or ten, of whom people said that she “ought to be painted.” Her parents had\nbeen continental wanderers, and after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both, and\nbeen taken in charge by her aunt, Medora Manson, also a wanderer, who was herself\nreturning to New York to “settle down.” …\nEvery one was disposed to be kind to little Ellen Mingott, though her dusky red cheeks\nand tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed unsuitable in a child who should still\nhave been in black for her parents. It was one of the misguided Medora’s many peculiarities\nto flout the unalterable rules that regulated American mourning, and when she stepped\nfrom the steamer her family were scandalised to see that the crape veil she wore for her\nown brother was seven inches shorter than those of her sisters-in-law, while little Ellen was\nin crimson merino and amber beads, like a gipsy foundling.\nBut New York had so long resigned itself to Medora that only a few old ladies shook\ntheir heads over Ellen’s gaudy clothes, while her other relations fell under the charm of\nher high colour and high spirits. She was a fearless and familiar little thing, who asked\ndisconcerting questions, made precocious comments, and possessed outlandish arts, such as\ndancing a Spanish shawl dance and singing Neapolitan love-songs to a guitar. Under the\ndirection of her aunt (whose real name was Mrs. Thorley Chivers, but who, having received\na Papal title, had resumed her first husband’s patronymic, and called herself the\nMarchioness Manson, because in Italy she could turn it into Manzoni) the little girl received\nan expensive but incoherent education, which included “drawing from the model,” a thing\nnever dreamed of before, and playing the piano in quintets with professional musicians. …\nThese things passed through Newland Archer’s mind a week later as he watched\nthe Countess Olenska enter the van der Luyden drawing-room on the evening of the\nmomentous dinner. The occasion was a solemn one, and he wondered a little nervously how\nshe would carry it off. She came rather late, one hand still ungloved, and fastening a\nbracelet about her wrist; yet she entered without any appearance of haste or embarrassment\nthe drawing-room in which New York’s most chosen company was somewhat awfully\nassembled.\nIn the middle of the room she paused, looking about her with a grave mouth and\nsmiling eyes; and in that instant Newland Archer rejected the general verdict on her looks.\nIt was true that her early radiance was gone. The red cheeks had paled; she was thin, worn,\na little older-looking than her age, which must have been nearly thirty. But there was about\nher the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in the carriage of the head, the movement\nof the eyes, which, without being in the least theatrical, struck him as highly trained and full\nof a conscious power. At the same time she was simpler in manner than most of the ladies\npresent, and many people (as he heard afterward from Janey) were disappointed that\nher appearance was not more “stylish” — for stylishness was what New York most valued.\nIt was, perhaps, Archer reflected, because her early vivacity had disappeared; because she\nwas so quiet—quiet in her movements, her voice, and the tones of her low-pitched voice.\nNew York had expected something a good deal more resonant in a young woman with such\na history.\nThe dinner was a somewhat formidable business. Dining with the van der Luydens was\nat best no light matter, and dining there with a Duke who was their cousin was almost\na religious solemnity. It pleased Archer to think that only an old New Yorker could perceive\nthe shade of difference (to New York) between being merely a Duke and being the van der\nLuydens’ Duke. New York took stray noblemen calmly, and even (except in the Struthers\nset) with a certain distrustful hauteur; but when they presented such credentials as these\nthey were received with an old-fashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly\nmistaken in ascribing solely to their standing in Debrett. It was for just such distinctions\nthat the young man cherished his old New York even while he smiled at it. …\nThe Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as Archer scanned\nthe smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich\nfeathers, they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers. It frightened him to\nthink what must have gone to the making of her eyes.\nThe Duke of St. Austrey, who sat at his hostess’s right, was naturally the chief figure of\nthe evening. But if the Countess Olenska was less conspicuous than had been hoped, the\nDuke was almost invisible. Being a well-bred man he had not (like another recent ducal\nvisitor) come to the dinner in a shooting-jacket; but his evening clothes were so shabby and\nbaggy, and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun, that (with his stooping\nway of sitting, and the vast beard spreading over his shirt-front) he hardly gave the\nappearance of being in dinner attire. He was short, round-shouldered, sunburnt, with\na thick nose, small eyes and a sociable smile; but he seldom spoke, and when he did it was\nin such low tones that, despite the frequent silences of expectation about the table,\nhis remarks were lost to all but his neighbours.\nWhen the men joined the ladies after dinner the Duke went straight up to the Countess\nOlenska, and they sat down in a corner and plunged into animated talk. Neither seemed\naware that the Duke should first have paid his respects to Mrs. Lovell Mingott and\nMrs. Headly Chivers, and the Countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac,\nMr. Urban Dagonet of Washington Square, who, in order to have the pleasure of meeting\nher, had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out between January and April. The two\nchatted together for nearly twenty minutes; then the Countess rose and, walking alone\nacross the wide drawing-room, sat down at Newland Archer’s side.\nIt was not the custom in New York drawing-rooms for a lady to get up and walk away\nfrom one gentleman in order to seek the company of another. Etiquette required that\nshe should wait, immovable as an idol, while the men who wished to converse with her \nsucceeded each other at her side. But the Countess was apparently unaware of having\nbroken any rule; she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside Archer, and looked at\nhim with the kindest eyes. …",

We [American\ncolonists] are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that syren\n[siren], till she seduces our judgments. Is it the part of wise men, engaged in a great and\narduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those, who having\neyes, see not, and having ears, hear not the things which so nearly concern our temporal\nsalvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it might cost, I am willing to know the\nwhole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet\nare guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future,\nbut by the past; and, judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the\nconduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which\ngentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house? Is it that insidious smile\nwith which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir, it will prove a snare\nto your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this\ngracious reception of our petition, comports with those warlike preparations which cover\nour waters and darken our land? Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\nreconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force must be\ncalled in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements\nof war and subjugation—the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen,\nsir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission?\nCan gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this\nquarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has\nnone: they are meant for us: they can be meant for no other purpose—they are sent over to\nbind and rivet upon us those chains, which the British ministry have been so long forging.\nAnd what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that\nfor the last ten years. Have we any thing new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have\nheld the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we\nresort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find, which have not been\nalready exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have\ndone every thing that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have\npetitioned—we have remonstrated we have supplicated—we have prostrated ourselves\nbefore the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of\nthe ministry and parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have\nproduced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we\nhave been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne.\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.\nThere is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean to preserve\ninviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending—if we\nmean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and\nwhich we have pledged ourselves never to abandon, until the glorious object of our contest\nshall be obtained—we must fight!—I repeat it, sir, we must fight—An appeal to arms and\nto the God of Hosts, is all that is left us!\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak—unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.\nBut when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when\nwe are totally disarmed; and when a British guard shall be stationed in our House? Shall\nwe gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual\nresistance, by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope,\nuntil our enemies shall have bound us, hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make\na proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power—three\nmillions of people, armed in the holy cause of Liberty, and in such a country as that which\nwe possess; are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.\nSir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God, who presides over the\ndestinies of nations, and will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not\nto the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have now no\nelection. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.\nThere is no retreat, but in submission and slavery. Our chains are forged:—their clanking\nmay be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable—and let it come!! I repeat it,\nsir, let it come!!!\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace—but there\nis no peace! The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north, will bring\nto our ears the clash of resounding arms!

        "passage": "…I assured his honor that law was a science, in which I had not much conversed,\nfurther than by employing advocates in vain, upon some injustice that had been done me:\nhowever, I would give him all the satisfaction I was able.\nI said there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in the art of\nproving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is black, and black is white,\naccording as they are paid. To this society all the rest of the people are slaves. For example,\nif my neighbor has a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow\nfrom me. I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against all rules of law that\nany man should be allowed to speak for himself. “Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner,\nlie under two great disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practiced almost from his cradle\nin defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an advocate for\njustice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts with great awkwardness, if not with\nill-will. The second disadvantage is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else\nhe will be reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that would\nlessen the practice of the law. And therefore I have but two methods to preserve my cow.\nThe first is, to gain over my adversary’s lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray\nhis client by insinuating that he has justice on his side. The second way is for my lawyer\nto make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong to my adversary;\nand this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly bespeak the favor of the bench. Now your\nhonor is to know that these judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of\nproperty as well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most dexterous\nlawyers, who have grown old or lazy; and having been biased all their lives against truth and\nequity, lie under such a fatal necessity of favoring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have\nknown some of them refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure\nthe faculty by doing anything unbecoming their nature or their office.\n“It is a maxim among these lawyers, that whatever has been done before may legally be\ndone again; and therefore they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made\nagainst common justice and the general reason of mankind. These, under the name of\nprecedents, they produce as authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions; and the\njudges never fail of directing accordingly.\n“In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the cause; but are loud,\nviolent, and tedious in dwelling upon all circumstances which are not to the purpose. For\ninstance, in the case already mentioned, they never desire to know what claim or title my\nadversary has to my cow, but whether the said cow were red or black, her horns long or\nshort; whether the field I graze her in be round or square; whether she was milked at home\nor abroad; what diseases she is subject to, and the like; after which they consult precedents,\nadjourn the case from time to time, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years come to an issue.\n“It is likewise to be observed that this society has a peculiar cant and jargon of their\nown that no other mortal can understand, and wherein all their laws are written, which they\ntake special care to multiply; whereby they have wholly confounded the very essence\nof truth and falsehood, of right and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to decide whether\nthe field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me or to a stranger\nthree hundred miles off.\n“In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the method is much more\nshort and commendable: the judge first sends to sound the disposition of those in power,\nafter which he can easily hang or save a criminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.”\nHere my master, interposing, said it was a pity that creatures endowed with such\nprodigious abilities of mind as these lawyers, by the description I gave of them, must\ncertainly be, were not rather encouraged to be instructors of others in wisdom and\nknowledge. In answer to which I assured his honor that in all points out of their own trade\nthey were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us; the most despicable\nin common conversation, avowed enemies to all knowledge and learning, and equally\ndisposed to pervert the general reason of mankind in every other subject of discourse as in\nthat of their own profession.",

        "passage": "The morning chill carried that clean-sheet crispness; that cleansing sort of air. Actually,\nfor the tip of Long Island in early December, this weather was a little late in coming. But\nwalking from our house to the shore of the bay, the new crystal air made me finally look\nahead toward winter and turn my back to what had been a spectacular, lingering fall.\nEvery autumn here witnesses two great migrations: one axiomatic and one nearly\nunknown. Everybody knows birds fly south for the winter. Here, the marshes and barrier\nislands are interstate arteries for heavy traffic of songbirds, waterfowl, hawks and others.\nBut except for people who fish, almost no one realizes the greater migration begins just\nbeyond the beach.\nThis year, as usual, swarms of fish had arrived from New England in the last few weeks\nand departed down the coast in great migrating waves. They included millions and millions\nof anchovies and menhaden, pursued to the surface by armies of bluefish, striped bass,\nlittle tuna. Along the seafloor battalions of summer flounder, black sea bass, tautog, porgies\nand others moved to deeper grounds. Offshore, beyond sight of land on the rolling blue\nprairies of the sea, sharks and tunas passed like herds on the Serengeti (though now, like\nthose herds, much diminished). Herring and mackerel had arrived mid-November with\ndolphins on their tails, and the remaining schools of striped bass, fattening for their long run\nto winter grounds, gobbled them greedily. Even now, into December, a few boats were still\nhunting bass. But we had caught enough, our freezer was stocked for winter and our smoker\nracks were busy, and we’d just hauled the boat.\nPatricia and I put our footsteps to the gravelly beach and walked to the inlet to see\nwho’d recently arrived. Bonaparte’s gulls, a few long-tailed ducks, some black scoters and in\nthe distance the feathered missiles called gannets were sending geysers skyward as a flock\npoured into a herring school. To me, this seasonal sense of place in the path of migrations,\nthis finger on the pulse of the planet, is the purest joy.\nWe were just rounding the inlet entrance when, among the shells and tide-wrack, my gaze\ncaught something so unexpected — here, and in this near-frost — it seemed improbable as\na fallen angel: a sea turtle.\nIt was a baby, with a platter-sized shell. Species: Kemp’s ridley, most endangered of all\nAtlantic turtles. Stunned by the boreal air and 49-degree water, the turtle’s only sign of life\nwas a mark in the wet sand suggesting a flipper had moved sometime since high tide had\nleft it and withdrawn.\nThis nation that sees itself stretching from sea to shining sea conceals beneath her\nbroad, waving skirts of bordering oceans some of the greatest wildlife in the world. And\nbecause it’s so effectively hidden, it’s some of the least understood.\nThough the saltiness of our blood and tears speaks from within of our parent ocean, for\nmost people oceans seem distant, out of sight and generally out of mind. Even many who\nlove nature, who see our landscape and imagine herds of bison and skies darkened by\npassenger pigeons and clouds of waterfowl, who escape into the woods or mountains or\neven the shore, seem to get their vision stranded on the beach as though wildlife stops at\nthe high-tide line, where our little stunned turtle reminded us that so much actually begins.\nThe water makes a perfect disguise that heightens the mystery, but in some ways that’s\na great pity, because the closest thing we have left to the thundering herds and great flocks\nis in the sea. Extending your vision into the grand swirl and suck of the many-fingered tides\nand beyond will grant you a renewed sense of both the abundance and fragility of life.\nWhether or not we can see, hear, or feel the ocean from our own home territory,\nthe ocean certainly feels all of us. Between a third and half the world’s people now live\nwithin 50 miles of a coast (as any traveler can attest). In China, population density is three\ntimes higher in coastal areas than elsewhere. The collective weight of humanity may rest on\nland, but we levy heavy pressure on the sea. Most of us exert our most direct interaction\nwith the sea through the seafood we buy. But even air quality affects water quality because\nwhat goes up alights elsewhere, and climate change is challenging ocean habitats by melting\nsea ice and cooking corals, undermining food supplies for penguins, polar bears and reef\nfishes.\nPeople who think of themselves as conservationists carry a concern for wildlife, wildlands\nand habitat quality as part of their sense of right and wrong. It is time to take these concerns\nbelow high tide. Most people would not question a hawk’s place in the sky, nor ask what\ngood is a gazelle, nor wonder whether the world really needs wild orchids. Yet when told of\nthe plight of, say, sharks, many still think it quite reasonable to inquire, “What good are they;\nwhy do we need them?” Fifty million buffalo once roamed the rolling green prairies of\nNorth America. Gunners reduced them to near-extinction. Now, hunters cut from the same\ncloth are at work on the rolling blue prairies of the sea and, already, the big fish — including\nmiracles like thousand-pound, warm-blooded bluefin tuna — are 90 percent gone. What we\nregret happening on land may again happen in the sea. Those who care about wildlife\nshould get to know about oceans.\nWe brought the turtle home and warmed it a bit in the sun. It began to shed tears, a sign\nof ongoing glandular function and, for us, heightened hope. Soon a flipper waved — a certain\nsignal of persistent life. Shortly thereafter, the aquarium people arrived to bring our little\npatient into veterinary rehab. Slowly warmed, within a few hours it was conscious and\nswimming, safe until release next spring.\nWhether we help one unlucky creature or wish to save the world, for each of us the\nchallenge and opportunity is to cherish all life as the gift it is, envision it whole, seek to know\nit truly, and undertake — with our minds, hearts and hands — to restore its abundance.\nWhere there’s life there’s hope, and so no place can inspire more hopefulness than\nthe great, life-making sea, home to creatures of mystery and majesty, whose future now\ndepends on human compassion, and our next move.",

        "passage": "The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned\nit. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and\nFoundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was\nfifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy\nwas named after Benjamin Franklin.\nOne Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.\nThey went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe.\n“Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought\nmaybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay\npigeons tomorrow.”\nRudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and\nhe had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who\nhad never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his\nshotgun. …\n“Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl\nalways did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …\nKarl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints\nseemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d\nlived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated\nfrom the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,\njust as his father had done.\n“Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.\n“Shoot what?” said Karl.\n“Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”\n“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …\nRudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The\ntapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was\ndoing fine.\nRudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy\nand Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant\ntoo. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …\nMerle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel\nplate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches\nsquare. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …\nFranklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much\nin the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the\ncold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls\nand cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of\npaint and grime, paint and grime.\nThere had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,\novernight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough\nshelves that lined the room. …\nMerle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he\nsaid.\n“Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an\napprentice in Sweden.”\nThe cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without\nletting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.\n“Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that\ncoming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he\nknew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time\nand great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.\n“It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle\ngravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”\n“Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”\n“Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar\nsadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me\nwhen I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …\n“I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”\nsaid Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why\nI’d feel like crying?” …\n“The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were\ninterchangeable!”\n“Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”\nAnd now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have\ngiven his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous\nirrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.\n“What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.\n“Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.\n“The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m\ndead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be\nconverted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for\nBroken-Down Actors?”\n“I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump\ninto something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was\nbeing asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something\nelse. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …\n“Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.\n“On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.\n“Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.\n“Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to\nbe an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my\nlife.”\n“Couldn’t we wait?”\n“For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.\n“Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and\nshook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want\nto do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what\nyou’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that\nwith my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help\nit. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …",

        "passage": "In the tragic situation which confronts humanity, we feel that scientists should\nassemble in conference to appraise the perils that have arisen as a result of the development\nof weapons of mass destruction, and to discuss a resolution in the spirit of the appended\ndraft.\nWe are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that nation, continent, or\ncreed, but as human beings, members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in\ndoubt. The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic\nstruggle between Communism and anti-Communism. …\nWe have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps\ncan be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are\nsuch steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a\nmilitary contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …\nNo doubt in an H-bomb war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the\nminor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and\nMoscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from\nthe blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, that nuclear bombs can\ngradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …\nMany warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in\nmilitary strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say\nis that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We\nhave not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon\ntheir politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon\nthe extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most\nare the most gloomy.\nHere, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:\nShall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face\nthis alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\nThe abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But\nwhat perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the\nterm “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the\ndanger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly\napprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,\nand those whom they love are in imminent danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they\nhope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are\nprohibited.\nThis hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in\ntime of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides\nwould set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side\nmanufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would\ninevitably be victorious.\nAlthough an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of\narmaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.\nFirst: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish\ntension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the\nother had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of\nPearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We\nshould, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.\nMost of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,\nif the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any\npossible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or\nEuropean or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by\nwar. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\nThere lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and\nwisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We\nappeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.\nIf you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you\nthe risk of universal death.\nResolution: We invite this Congress, and through it the scientists of the world and the general\npublic, to subscribe to the following resolution:\n“In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be\nemployed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge\nthe Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their\npurpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find\npeaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”",

        "passage": "…When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners.\nWhen we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was\nthe colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble\nlanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in\nthe silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind\nthe houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back\ndoors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark\nodorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from\nthe buckled harness. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had\nfilled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had\nseen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother\nin to his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to\nsee whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked\nup to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from\nthe half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the\nrailings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair\ntossed from side to side.\nEvery morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was\npulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out\non the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept\nher brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways\ndiverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning.\nI had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a\nsummons to all my foolish blood. …\nAt last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused\nthat I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forget whether\nI answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said she would love to go.\n‘And why can’t you?’ I asked.\nWhile she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not\ngo, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and\ntwo other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of\nthe spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught\nthe white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand\nupon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat,\njust visible as she stood at ease.\n‘It’s well for you,’ she said.\n‘If I go,’ I said, ‘I will bring you something.’\nWhat innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that\nevening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of\nschool. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me\nand the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through\nthe silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked\nfor leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised and hoped it was not\nsome Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master’s face pass\nfrom amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my\nwandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which,\nnow that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child’s play, ugly monotonous\nchild’s play.\nOn Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the\nevening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:\n‘Yes, boy, I know.’ …\nAt nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him talking to\nhimself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat.\nI could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give\nme the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.\n‘The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,’ he said.\nI did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically: ‘Can’t you give him the money and\nlet him go? You’ve kept him late enough as it is.’…\nI held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the\nstation. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me\nthe purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After\nan intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among\nruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people\npressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special\ntrain for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew\nup beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the\nlighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building\nwhich displayed the magical name. …\nRemembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the stalls and\nexamined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was\ntalking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English accents and\nlistened vaguely to their conversation. …\nObserving me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything.\nThe tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense\nof duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the\ndark entrance to the stall and murmured:\n‘No, thank you.’\nThe young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young\nmen. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me\nover her shoulder.\nI lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in\nher wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of\nthe bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a\nvoice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was\nnow completely dark.\nGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and\nmy eyes burned with anguish and anger.",

        "passage": "…Memory teaches me what I know of these matters. The boy reminds the adult. I was\na bilingual child, but of a certain kind: “socially disadvantaged,” the son of working-class\nparents, both Mexican immigrants. …\nIn public, my father and mother spoke a hesitant, accented, and not always grammatical\nEnglish. And then they would have to strain, their bodies tense, to catch the sense of what\nwas rapidly said by los gringos. At home, they returned to Spanish. The language of their\nMexican past sounded in counterpoint to the English spoken in public. The words would\ncome quickly, with ease. Conveyed through those sounds was the pleasing, soothing,\nconsoling reminder that one was at home.\nDuring those years when I was first learning to speak, my mother and father addressed\nme only in Spanish; in Spanish I learned to reply. By contrast, English (inglés) was the\nlanguage I came to associate with gringos, rarely heard in the house. I learned my first\nwords of English overhearing my parents speaking to strangers. At six years of age, I knew\njust enough words for my mother to trust me on errands to stores one block away—but no\nmore.\nI was then a listening child, careful to hear the very different sounds of Spanish and\nEnglish. Wide-eyed with hearing, I’d listen to sounds more than to words. First, there were\nEnglish (gringo) sounds. So many words still were unknown to me that when the butcher\nor the lady at the drugstore said something, exotic polysyllabic sounds would bloom in the\nmidst of their sentences. Often the speech of people in public seemed to me very loud,\nbooming with confidence. The man behind the counter would literally ask, “What can I do\nfor you?” But by being so firm and clear, the sound of his voice said that he was a gringo;\nhe belonged in public society. There were also the high, nasal notes of middle-class\nAmerican speech—which I rarely am conscious of hearing today because I hear them so\noften, but could not stop hearing when I was a boy. Crowds at Safeway or at bus stops were\nnoisy with the birdlike sounds of los gringos. I’d move away from them all—all the chirping\nchatter above me.\nMy own sounds I was unable to hear, but I knew that I spoke English poorly. My words\ncould not extend to form complete thoughts. And the words I did speak I didn’t know well\nenough to make distinct sounds. (Listeners would usually lower their heads to hear better\nwhat I was trying to say). But it was one thing for me to speak English with difficulty; it was\nmore troubling to hear my parents speaking in public: their high-whining vowels and\nguttural consonants; their sentences that got stuck with “eh” and “ah” sounds; the confused\nsyntax; the hesitant rhythm of sounds so different from the way gringos spoke. I’d notice,\nmoreover, that my parents’ voices were softer than those of gringos we would meet.\nI am tempted to say now that none of this mattered. (In adulthood I am embarrassed\nby childhood fears.) And, in a way, it didn’t matter very much that my parents could not\nspeak English with ease. Their linguistic difficulties had no serious consequences.\nMy mother and father made themselves understood at the county hospital clinic and at\ngovernment offices. And yet, in another way, it mattered very much. It was unsettling to\nhear my parents struggle with English. Hearing them, I’d grow nervous, and my clutching\ntrust in their protection and power would be weakened. …\nBut then there was Spanish: español, the language rarely heard away from the house;\nespañol, the language which seemed to me therefore a private language, my family’s\nlanguage. To hear its sounds was to feel myself specially recognized as one of the family,\napart from los otros. A simple remark, an inconsequential comment could convey that\nassurance. My parents would say something to me and I would feel embraced by the sounds\nof their words. Those sounds said: I am speaking with ease in Spanish. I am addressing you\nin words I never use with los gringos. I recognize you as someone special, close, like no one\noutside. You belong with us. In the family. Ricardo.\nAt the age of six, well past the time when most middle-class children no longer notice\nthe difference between sounds uttered at home and words spoken in public, I had a\ndifferent experience. I lived in a world compounded of sounds. I was a child longer than\nmost. I lived in a magical world, surrounded by sounds both pleasing and fearful. I shared\nwith my family a language enchantingly private—different from that used in the city around\nus. …\nIf I rehearse here the changes in my private life after my Americanization, it is finally\nto emphasize a public gain. The loss implies the gain. The house I returned to each\nafternoon was quiet. Intimate sounds no longer greeted me at the door. Inside there were\nother noises. The telephone rang. Neighborhood kids ran past the door of the bedroom\nwhere I was reading my schoolbooks—covered with brown shopping-bag paper. Once\nI learned the public language, it would never again be easy for me to hear intimate family\nvoices. More and more of my day was spent hearing words, not sounds. But that may only\nbe a way of saying that on the day I raised my hand in class and spoke loudly to an entire\nroomful of faces, my childhood started to end. …",

        "passage": "…Three years in London had not changed Richard, although it had changed the way\nhe perceived the city. Richard had originally imagined London as a gray city, even a black\ncity, from pictures he had seen, and he was surprised to find it filled with color. It was a city\nof red brick and white stone, red buses and large black taxis, bright red mailboxes and green\ngrassy parks and cemeteries. …\nTwo thousand years before, London had been a little Celtic village on the north shore\nof the Thames, which the Romans had encountered, then settled in. London had grown,\nslowly, until, roughly a thousand years later, it met the tiny Royal City of Westminster\nimmediately to the west, and, once London Bridge had been built, London touched the\ntown of Southwark directly across the river; and it continued to grow, fields and woods and\nmarshland slowly vanishing beneath the flourishing town, and it continued to expand,\nencountering other little villages and hamlets as it grew, like Whitechapel and Deptford to\nthe east, Hammersmith and Shepherd’s Bush to the west, Camden and Islington in the\nnorth, Battersea and Lambeth across the Thames to the south, absorbing all of them,\njust as a pool of mercury encounters and incorporates smaller beads of mercury, leaving\nonly their names behind.\nLondon grew into something huge and contradictory. It was a good place, and a fine\ncity, but there is a price to be paid for all good places, and a price that all good places have\nto pay.\nAfter a while, Richard found himself taking London for granted; in time, he began to\npride himself on having visited none of the sights of London (except for the Tower of\nLondon, when his Aunt Maude came down to the city for a weekend, and Richard found\nhimself her reluctant escort).\nBut Jessica changed all that. Richard found himself, on otherwise sensible weekends,\naccompanying her to places like the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery, where he\nlearned that walking around museums too long hurts your feet, that the great art treasures\nof the world all blur into each other after a while, and that it is almost beyond the human\ncapacity for belief to accept how much museum cafeterias will brazenly charge for a slice of\ncake and a cup of tea. …\nRichard had been awed by Jessica, who was beautiful, and often quite funny, and was\ncertainly going somewhere. And Jessica saw in Richard an enormous amount of potential,\nwhich, properly harnessed by the right woman, would have made him the perfect\nmatrimonial accessory. If only he were a little more focused, she would murmur to herself,\nand so she gave him books with titles like Dress for Success and A Hundred and Twenty-\nFive Habits of Successful Men, and books on how to run a business like a military campaign,\nand Richard always said thank you, and always intended to read them. In Harvey Nichols’s\nmen’s fashion department she would pick out for him the kinds of clothes she thought that\nhe should wear—and he wore them, during the week, anyway; and, a year to the day after\ntheir first encounter, she told him she thought it was time that they went shopping for an\nengagement ring.\n“Why do you go out with her?” asked Gary, in Corporate Accounts, eighteen months\nlater. “She’s terrifying.”\nRichard shook his head. “She’s really sweet, once you get to know her.”\nGary put down the plastic troll doll he had picked up from Richard’s desk. “I’m\nsurprised she still lets you play with these.” …\nIt was a Friday afternoon. Richard had noticed that events were cowards: they didn’t\noccur singly, but instead they would run in packs and leap out at him all at once. Take this\nparticular Friday, for example. It was, as Jessica had pointed out to him at least a dozen\ntimes in the last month, the most important day of his life. So it was unfortunate that,\ndespite the Post-it note Richard had left on his fridge door at home, and the other Post-it\nnote he had placed on the photograph of Jessica on his desk, he had forgotten about it\ncompletely and utterly.\nAlso, there was the Wandsworth report, which was overdue and taking up most of his\nhead. Richard checked another row of figures; then he noticed that page 17 had vanished,\nand he set it up to print out again; and another page down, and he knew that if he were only\nleft alone to finish it…if, miracle of miracles, the phone did not ring.…It rang. He thumbed\nthe speakerphone.\n“Hello? Richard? The managing director needs to know when he’ll have the report.”\nRichard looked at his watch. “Five minutes, Sylvia. It’s almost wrapped up. I just have\nto attach the P & L projection.”\n“Thanks, Dick. I’ll come down for it.” Sylvia was, as she liked to explain, “the MD’s PA,”\n[Managing Director’s Personal Assistant] and she moved in an atmosphere of crisp\nefficiency. He thumbed the speakerphone off; it rang again, immediately. “Richard,” said\nthe speaker, with Jessica’s voice, “it’s Jessica. You haven’t forgotten, have you?”\n“Forgotten?” He tried to remember what he could have forgotten. He looked at\nJessica’s photograph for inspiration and found all the inspiration he could have needed in\nthe shape of a yellow Post-it note stuck to her forehead.\n“Richard? Pick up the telephone.”\nHe picked up the phone, reading the Post-it note as he did so. “Sorry, Jess. No, I hadn’t\nforgotten. Seven P.M., at Ma Maison Italiano. Should I meet you there?”\n“Jessica, Richard. Not Jess.” She paused for a moment. “After what happened last time?\nI don’t think so. You really could get lost in your own backyard, Richard.” …\n“I’ll meet you at your place,” said Jessica. “We can walk down together.”\n“Right, Jess. Jessica—sorry.”\n“You have confirmed our reservation, haven’t you, Richard.”\n“Yes,” lied Richard earnestly. The other line on his phone had begun to ring. “Jessica,\nlook, I…”\n“Good,” said Jessica, and she broke the connection. He picked up the other line.\n“Hi Dick. It’s me, Gary.” Gary sat a few desks down from Richard. He waved. “Are we\nstill on for drinks? You said we could go over the Merstham account.”\n“Get off the bloody phone, Gary. Of course we are.” Richard put down the phone.\nThere was a telephone number at the bottom of the Post-it note; Richard had written the\nPost-it note to himself, several weeks earlier. And he had made the reservation: he was\nalmost certain of that. But he had not confirmed it. He had kept meaning to, but there had\nbeen so much to do and Richard had known that there was plenty of time. But events run\nin packs…\nSylvia was now standing next to him. “Dick? The Wandsworth report?”\n“Almost ready, Sylvia. Look, just hold on a sec, can you?”\nHe finished punching in the number, breathed a sigh of relief when somebody\nanswered. “Ma Maison. Can I help you?”\n“Yes,” said Richard. “A table for three, for tonight. I think I booked it. And if I did I’m\nconfirming the reservation. And if I didn’t, I wondered if I could book it. Please.” No, they\nhad no record of a table for tonight in the name of Mayhew. Or Stockton. Or Bartram—\nJessica’s surname. And as for booking a table…\nThey had put down the phone.\n“Richard?” said Sylvia. “The MD’s waiting.”\n“Do you think,” asked Richard, “they’d give me a table if I phoned back and offered\nthem extra money?” …",

Our auditory range is from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz: from the\nlowest pitch on the longest organ pipe to an impossibly squeaky squeak. We spend most of\nour time straining to understand sounds between 100 hertz and 1 kilohertz, the range of any\ninteresting speech going on in the vicinity. Dogs hear most of what we hear and then some.\nThey can detect sounds up to 45 kilohertz, much higher than the hair cells of our ears\nbother to bend to. Hence the power of the dog whistle, a seemingly magical device that\nmakes no apparent sound and yet perks the ears of dogs for blocks around. We call this\nsound “ultrasonic,” since it’s beyond our ken,1 but it is within the sonic range for many\nanimals in our local environment. Don’t think for a moment that apart from the occasional\ndog whistle, the world is quiet for dogs up at those high registers. Even a typical room is\npulsing with high frequencies, detectable by dogs constantly. Think your bedroom is quiet\nwhen you rise in the morning? The crystal resonator used in digital alarm clocks emits a\nnever-ending alarm of high-frequency pulses audible to canine ears. Dogs can hear the\nnavigational chirping of rats behind your walls and the bodily vibrations of termites within\nyour walls. That compact fluorescent light you installed to save energy? You may not hear\nthe hum, but your dog probably can.\nThe range of pitches we are most intent on are those used in speech. Dogs hear all\nsounds of speech, and are nearly as good as we are at detecting a change of pitch—relevant,\nsay, for understanding statements, which end in a low pitch, versus questions, which in\nEnglish end in a raised pitch: “Do you want to go for a walk(?)” With the question mark,\nthis sentence is exciting to a dog with experience going on walks with humans. Without it,\nit is simply noise. Imagine the confusion generated by the recent growth of “up-talking,”\nspeech that ends every sentence with the sound of a question?\nIf dogs understand the stress and tones—the prosody—of speech, does this hint that\nthey understand language? This is a natural but vexed question. Since language use is one\nof the most glaring differences between the human animal and all other animals, it has been\nproposed as the ultimate, incomparable criterion for intelligence. This raises serious hackles\nin some animal researchers (not thought of as a hackled species, ironically), who have set\nabout trying to demonstrate what linguistic ability animals have. Even those researchers\nwho may agree that language is necessary for intelligence have nonetheless added reams of\nresults to the growing pile of evidence of linguistic ability in non-human animals. All parties\nagree, though, that there has been no discovery of a humanlike language—a corpus of\ninfinitely combinable words that often carry many definitions, with rules for combining\nwords into meaningful sentences—in animals.\nThis is not to say that animals might not understand some of our language use, even if\nthey don’t produce it themselves. There are, for instance, many examples of animals taking\nadvantage of the communicative system of nearby unrelated animal species. Monkeys can\nmake use of nearby birds’ warning calls of a nearby predator to themselves take protective\naction. Even an animal who deceives another animal by mimicry—which some snakes,\nmoths, and even flies can do—is in some way using another species’s [sic] language.\nThe research with dogs suggests that they do understand language—to a limited degree.\nOn the one hand, to say that dogs understand words is a misnomer. Words exist in a\nlanguage, which itself is product of a culture; dogs are participants in that culture on a very\ndifferent level. Their framework for understanding the application of the word is entirely\ndifferent. There is, no doubt, more to the words of their world than Gary Larson’s Far Side\ncomics suggest: eat, walk, and fetch. But he is on to something, insofar as these are\norganizing elements of their interaction with us: we circumscribe the dog’s world to a small\nset of activities. Working dogs seem miraculously responsive and focused compared to city\npets. It is not that they are innately more responsive or focused, but that their owners have\nadded to their vocabularies types of things to do.\nOne component in understanding a word is the ability to discriminate it from other\nwords. Given their sensitivity to the prosody of speech, dogs do not always excel at this.\nTry asking your dog on one morning to go for a walk; on the next, ask if your dog wants to\nsnow forty locks in the same voice. If everything else remains the same, you’ll probably get\nthe same, affirmative reaction. The very first sounds of an utterance seem to be important\nto dog perception, though, so changing the swallowed consonants for articulated ones and\nthe long vowels for short ones—ma for a polk?—might prompt the confusion merited by\nthis gibberish. Of course humans read meaning into prosody, too. English does not give the\nprosody of speech syntactical leverage but it is still part of how we interpret “what has just\nbeen said.”\nIf we were more sensitive to the sound of what we say to dogs, we might get better\nresponses from them. High-pitched sounds mean something different than low sounds;\nrising sounds contrast with falling sounds. It is not accidental that we find ourselves cooing\nto an infant in silly, giddy tones (called motherese)—and might greet a wagging dog with\nsimilar baby talk. Infants can hear other speech sounds, but they are more interested in\nmotherese. Dogs, too, respond with alacrity  to baby talk—partially because it distinguishes\nspeech that is directed at them from the rest of the continuous yammering above their\nheads. Moreover, they will come more easily to high-pitched and repeated call requests\nthan to those at a lower pitch. What is the ecology behind this? High-pitched sounds are\nnaturally interesting to dogs: they might indicate the excitement of a tussle or the shrieking\nof nearby injured prey. If a dog fails to respond to your reasonable suggestion that he come\nright now, resist the urge to lower and sharpen your tone. It indicates your frame of mind—\nand the punishment that might ensue for his prior uncooperativeness. Correspondingly,\nit is easier to get a dog to sit on command to a longer, descending tone rather than repeated,\nrising notes. Such a tone might be more likely to induce relaxation, or preparation for the\nnext command from their talky human. …",

        "passage": "…The windows were open and the room was filled with loud, unearthly shrieks.\nMrs. Munson lived on the third floor, and across the street was a public school playground.\nIn the late afternoon the noise was almost unbearable. God, if she’d only known about this\nbefore she signed the lease! With a little grunt she closed both windows and as far as she\nwas concerned they could stay that way for the next two years.\nBut Mrs. Munson was far too excited to be really annoyed. Vini Rondo was coming to\nsee her, imagine, Vini Rondo.…and this very afternoon! When she thought about it she felt\nfluttering wings in her stomach. It had been almost five years, and Vini had been in Europe\nall this time. Whenever Mrs. Munson found herself in a group discussing the war she\ninvariably announced, “Well, you know I have a very dear friend in Paris this very minute,\nVini Rondo, she was right there when the Germans marched in! I have positive nightmares\nwhen I think what she must be going through!” Mrs. Munson said it as if it were she whose\nfate lay in the balance. …\n“Vini, back in America,” she thought, never ceasing to revel in the wonder of it.\nShe puffed up the small green pillows on the couch and sat down. With piercing eyes she\nexamined her room. Funny you never really see your surroundings until a visitor is\nexpected. Well, Mrs. Munson sighed contentedly, that new girl had, for a rarity, restored\npre-war standards.\nThe door-bell rang abruptly. It buzzed twice before Mrs. Munson could move, she was\nthat excited. Finally she composed herself and went to answer.\nAt first Mrs. Munson didn’t recognize her. The woman who confronted her had no chic\nup-swept coiffure … indeed her hair hung rather limply and had an uncombed look. A print\ndress in January? Mrs. Munson tried to keep the disappointment out of her voice when she\nsaid, “Vini, darling, I should have known you anywhere.”\nThe woman still stood in the threshold. Under her arm she carried a large pink box and\nher grey eyes looked out at Mrs. Munson curiously.\n“Would you, Bertha?” Her voice was a queer whisper. “That’s nice, very nice. I should\nhave recognized you, too, although you’ve gotten rather fat. [sic] haven’t you?” Then she\naccepted Mrs. Munson’s extended hand and came in. …\nVini smiled and Mrs. Munson noticed how irregular her teeth were and decided they\ncould do with a good brushing.\n“So,” Vini continued, “when I got back in New York last week I thought of you at once.\nI had an awful time trying to find you because I couldn’t remember your husband’s first\nname.…”\n“Albert,” Mrs. Munson put in unnecessarily.\n“… but I finally did and here I am. You know, Bertha, I really started thinking about you\nwhen I decided to get rid of my mink coat.”\nMrs. Munson saw a sudden blush on Vini’s face.\n“Your mink coat?”\n“Yes,” Vini said, lifting up the pink box. “You remember my mink coat. You always\nadmired it so. You always said it was the loveliest coat you’d ever seen.” She started to undo\nthe frayed silk ribbon that held the box together.\n“Of course, yes of course,” Mrs. Munson said, letting the “course” trill down softly.\n“I said to myself, ‘Vini Rondo, what on earth do you need that coat for? Why not let\nBertha have it?’ You see, Bertha, I bought the most gorgeous sable in Paris and you can\nunderstand that I really don’t need two fur coats. Besides I have my silver-fox jacket.”\nMrs. Munson watched her parting the tissue paper in the box, saw the chipped enamel\non her nails, saw that her fingers were jewel-less, and suddenly realized a great many other\nthings.\n“So I thought of you and unless you want it I’ll just keep it because I couldn’t bear to\nthink of anyone else having it.” She held the coat and stood turning it this way and that.\nIt was a beautiful coat; the fur shone rich and very smooth. Mrs. Munson reached out and\nran her fingers across it ruffling the tiny hairs the wrong way. Without thinking she said:\n“How much?”\nMrs. Munson brought back her hand quickly, as though she had touched fire, and then\nshe heard Vini’s voice, small and tired.\n“I paid almost a thousand for it. Is a thousand too much?”\nDown in the street Mrs. Munson could hear the deafening roar of the playground and\nfor once she was grateful. It gave her something else to concentrate on, something to lessen\nthe intensity of her own feelings.\n“I’m afraid that’s too much. I really can’t afford it,” Mrs. Munson said distractedly,\nstill staring at the coat, afraid to lift her eyes and see the other woman’s face.\nVini tossed the coat on the couch. “Well, I want you to have it. It’s not so much the\nmoney, but I feel I should get something back on my investment.…How much could you\nafford?”\nMrs. Munson closed her eyes. Oh, God, this was awful! Just plain damned awful!\n“Maybe four hundred,” she answered weakly. …\nVini leaned against the wall, her pale face looking hard in the magnified sunlight of the\nbig bedroom windows.\n“You can make out the check to me,” she said disinterestedly.\n“Yes, of course,” Mrs. Munson said, suddenly coming back to earth. Imagine Bertha Munson\nwith a mink of her own!\nThey went back into the livingroom and she wrote the check for Vini. Carefully folding\nit, Vini deposited it in her small beaded purse.\nMrs. Munson tried hard to make conversation but she came up against a cold wall at\neach new channel. Once she asked, “Where is your husband, Vini? You must bring him\naround for Albert to talk to.” And Vini answered, “Oh, him! I haven’t seen him for aeons.\nHe’s still in Lisbon for all I know.” And so that was that.\nFinally, after promising to phone the next day, Vini left. When she had gone Mrs. Munson\nthought, “Why, poor Vini, she’s nothing but a refugee!” Then she took her new coat and\nwent into the bedroom. She couldn’t tell Albert how she got it, that was definite. My, but\nhe would be mad about the money! She decided to hide it in the furthest reaches of her\ncloset and then one day she’d bring it out and say, “Albert look at the divine mink I bought\nat an auction. I got it for next to nothing.”\nGroping in the darkness of her closet she caught the coat on a hook. She gave a little\nyank and was terrified to hear the sound of ripping. Quickly she snapped on the light and\nsaw that the sleeve was torn. She held the tear apart and pulled slightly. It ripped more and\nthen some more. With a sick emptiness she knew the whole thing was rotten. “Oh, my God\n[sic] she said, clutching at the linen rose in her hair, “Oh, my God, I’ve been taken and taken\ngood, and there’s nothing in the world I can do about it, nothing in the world!” For suddenly\nMrs. Munson realized Vini wouldn’t phone tomorrow or ever again.",

        "passage": "Peter Lake lies deep in a maple forest near the Wisconsin-Michigan border. One day in\nJuly 2008 a group of scientists and graduate students led by ecologist Stephen Carpenter of\nthe University of Wisconsin-Madison arrived at the lake with some fish. One by one, they\ndropped 12 largemouth bass into the water. Then they headed for home, leaving behind\nsensors that could measure water clarity every five minutes, 24 hours a day.\nThe scientists repeated the same trip two more times in 2009. Each time they dropped\n15 more bass into the water. Months passed. The lake cycled through the seasons. It froze\nover, thawed out and bloomed again with life. Then, in the summer of 2010, Peter Lake\nchanged dramatically. Before the scientists started their experiment, the lake abounded in\nfathead minnows, pumpkinseeds and other small fish. Now, however, those once dominant\npredators were rare, for the most part eaten by the largemouth bass. The few survivors hid\nin the shallows. Water fleas and other tiny animals that the small fish once devoured were\nnow free to flourish. And because these diminutive animals graze on algae, the lake water\nbecame clearer. Two years later the ecosystem remains in its altered state.\nPeter Lake’s food web has flipped, shifting from a longstanding arrangement to a new\none. Carpenter triggered the switchover on purpose, as part of an experiment he is running\non the factors that lead to persistent changes in the mix of organisms eating and being eaten\nby one another. Yet in recent decades food webs across the world have also been flipping,\noften unexpectedly, on a far greater scale. Jellyfish now dominate the waters off the coast of\nNamibia. Hungry snails and fungi are overrunning coastal marshes in North Carolina,\ncausing them to disintegrate. In the northwestern Atlantic, lobsters are proliferating while\ncod have crashed.\nWhether by fishing, converting land into farms and cities, or warming the planet,\nhumanity is putting tremendous stresses on the world’s ecosystems. As a result, ecologists\nexpect many more food webs to flip in the years ahead. Predicting those sudden changes is\nfar from straightforward, however, because food webs can be staggeringly complex.\nThat is where Carpenter comes in. Taking advantage of 30 years of ecological research\nat Peter Lake, Carpenter and his colleagues developed mathematical models of ecological\nnetworks that allowed them to pick up early-warning signs of the change that was coming,\n15 months before its food web flipped. “We could see it a good long ways in advance,”\nCarpenter says.\nWith the help of such models, he and other scientists are beginning to decipher some\nof the rules that determine whether a food web will remain stable or cross a threshold and\nchange substantially. They hope to use their knowledge of those rules to monitor the state\nof ecosystems so that they can identify ones at risk of collapse. Ideally, an early-warning\nsystem would tell us when to alter human activities that are pushing an ecosystem toward\na breakdown or would even allow us to pull ecosystems back from the brink. Prevention is\nkey, they say, because once ecosystems pass their tipping point, it is remarkably difficult for\nthem to return.\nCarpenter’s work builds on a century of basic research by ecologists who have sought to\nanswer a simple question: Why are the populations of different species the way they are?\nWhy, for example, are there so many flies and so few wolves? And why do the sizes of fly\npopulations vary greatly from one year to the next? To find an answer, ecologists began to\ndiagram food webs, noting who ate whom and how much each one ate. Yet food webs can\nencompass dozens, hundreds or thousands of species; their complexity often turned\nattempted diagrams into hopeless snarls.\nTo make sense of the snarls, ecologists have turned food webs into mathematical\nmodels. They write an equation for the growth of one species by linking its reproduction\nrate to how much food it can obtain and how often it gets eaten by other species. Because\nall those variables can change, solving the equations for even simple food webs has proved\noverwhelming. Fortunately, the rise of fast, cheap computers has recently allowed\necologists to run simulations of many different kinds of ecosystems.\nOut of this work, ecologists discovered some key principles operating in real food webs.\nMost food webs, for instance, consist of many weak links rather than a few strong ones.\nTwo species are strongly linked if they interact a lot, such as a predator that consistently\ndevours huge numbers of a single prey. Species that are weakly linked interact occasionally:\na predator snacks every now and then on various species. Food webs may be dominated by\nnumerous weak links because that arrangement is more stable over the long term. If a\npredator can eat several species, it can survive the extinction of one of them. And if a predator\ncan move on to another species that is easier to find when a prey species becomes rare,\nthe switch allows the original prey to recover. The weak links may thus keep species from\ndriving one another to extinction. “You see it over and over again,” says Kevin McCann,\nan ecologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario.\nMathematical models have also revealed vulnerable points in food webs, where small\nchanges can lead to big effects throughout entire ecosystems. In the 1960s, for example,\ntheoreticians proposed that predators at the top of a food web exerted a surprising amount\nof control over the size of populations of other species—including species they did not\ndirectly attack. The idea of this top-down control by a small fraction of animals in an\necosystem was greeted with skepticism. It was hard to see how a few top predators could\nhave such a great effect on the rest of their food web.\nBut then we humans began running unplanned experiments that put this so-called\ntrophic cascade hypothesis to the test. In the ocean, we fished for top predators such as\ncod on an industrial scale, while on land, we killed off large predators such as wolves. We\nintroduced invasive species such as rats to islands and gave a variety of other shocks to the\nworld’s ecosystems. The results of these actions vindicated the key role of predators and the\ncascading effects they can have from the top of a food web on down. …\nCarpenter is optimistic that the early-warning system he is developing will work not just\nin isolated lakes but in any ecosystem, thanks to the way ecological networks are organized.\nYet success would not mean that predicting a flip would be certain. The equations that he\nand his colleagues have developed suggest that some disturbances will be so dramatic and\nfast that they will not leave time for ecologists to notice that trouble is coming. “Surprises\nwill continue,” Carpenter says, “although the early-warning system does provide the\nopportunity to anticipate some surprises before they happen.”",

        "passage": "I received one morning a letter, written in pale ink on glassy, blue-lined note-paper, and\nbearing the postmark of a little Nebraska village. This communication, worn and rubbed,\nlooking as if it had been carried for some days in a coat pocket that was none too clean, was\nfrom my uncle Howard, and informed me that his wife had been left a small legacy by a\nbachelor relative, and that it would be necessary for her to go to Boston to attend to the\nsettling of the estate. He requested me to meet her at the station and render her whatever\nservices might be necessary. On examining the date indicated as that of her arrival, I found\nit to be no later than tomorrow. He had characteristically delayed writing until, had I been\naway from home for a day, I must have missed my aunt altogether. …\nWhatever shock Mrs. Springer [the landlady] experienced at my aunt’s appearance,\nshe considerately concealed. As for myself, I saw my aunt’s battered figure with that feeling\nof awe and respect with which we behold explorers who have left their ears and fingers\nnorth of Franz-Joseph-Land, or their health somewhere along the Upper Congo. My Aunt\nGeorgiana had been a music teacher at the Boston Conservatory, somewhere back in the\nlatter sixties [1860s]. One summer, while visiting in the little village among the Green\nMountains where her ancestors had dwelt for generations, she had kindled the callow\nfancy of my uncle, Howard Carpenter, then an idle, shiftless boy of twenty-one. When she\nreturned to her duties in Boston, Howard followed her, and the upshot of this infatuation\nwas that she eloped with him, eluding the reproaches of her family and the criticism of her\nfriends by going with him to the Nebraska frontier. Carpenter, who, of course, had\nno money, took up a homestead in Red Willow County, fifty miles from the railroad.\nThere they had measured off their land themselves, driving across the prairie in a wagon,\nto the wheel of which they had tied a red cotton handkerchief, and counting its revolutions.\nThey built a dug-out in the red hillside, one of those cave dwellings whose inmates so often\nreverted to primitive conditions. Their water they got from the lagoons where the buffalo\ndrank, and their slender stock of provisions was always at the mercy of bands of roving\nIndians. For thirty years my aunt had not been farther than fifty miles from the homestead.\nI owed to this woman most of the good that ever came my way in my boyhood, and had\na reverential affection for her. During the years when I was riding herd for my uncle,\nmy aunt, after cooking the three meals — the first of which was ready at six o’clock in the\nmorning — and putting the six children to bed, would often stand until midnight at her\nironing-board, with me at the kitchen table beside her, hearing me recite Latin declensions\nand conjugations, gently shaking me when my drowsy head sank down over a page of\nirregular verbs. It was to her, at her ironing or mending, that I read my first Shakspere,\nand her old text-book on mythology was the first that ever came into my empty hands.\nShe taught me my scales and exercises on the little parlour organ which her husband had\nbought her after fifteen years during which she had not so much as seen a musical \ninstrument. She would sit beside me by the hour, darning and counting, while I struggled\nwith the “Joyous Farmer.” She seldom talked to me about music, and I understood why.\nOnce when I had been doggedly beating out some easy passages from an old score of\nEuryanthe I had found among her music books, she came up to me and, putting her hands\nover my eyes, gently drew my head back upon her shoulder, saying tremulously, “Don’t love\nit so well, Clark, or it may be taken from you.”…\nAt two o’clock the Symphony Orchestra was to give a Wagner program, and I intended\nto take my aunt; though, as I conversed with her, I grew doubtful about her enjoyment of\nit. I suggested our visiting the Conservatory and the Common before lunch, but she seemed\naltogether too timid to wish to venture out. She questioned me absently about various\nchanges in the city, but she was chiefly concerned that she had forgotten to leave\ninstructions about feeding half-skimmed milk to a certain weakling calf, “old Maggie’s calf,\nyou know, Clark,” she explained, evidently having forgotten how long I had been away.\nShe was further troubled because she had neglected to tell her daughter about the freshly-\nopened kit of mackerel in the cellar, which would spoil if it were not used directly. …\nThe first number [of the concert] was the Tannhauser overture. When the horns drew\nout the first strain of the Pilgrim’s chorus, Aunt Georgiana clutched my coat sleeve. Then it\nwas I first realized that for her this broke a silence of thirty years. With the battle between\nthe two motives, with the frenzy of the Venusberg theme and its ripping of strings, there\ncame to me an overwhelming sense of the waste and wear we are so powerless to combat;\nand I saw again the tall, naked house on the prairie, black and grim as a wooden fortress;\nthe black pond where I had learned to swim, its margin pitted with sun-dried cattle tracks;\nthe rain gullied clay banks about the naked house, the four dwarf ash seedlings where the\ndish-cloths were always hung to dry before the kitchen door. The world there was the flat\nworld of the ancients; to the east, a cornfield that stretched to daybreak; to the west, a corral\nthat reached to sunset; between, the conquests of peace, dearer-bought than those of war. …\nHer lip quivered and she hastily put her handkerchief up to her mouth. From behind it\nshe murmured, “And you have been hearing this ever since you left me, Clark?” Her\nquestion was the gentlest and saddest of reproaches. …\nThe deluge of sound poured on and on; I never knew what she found in the shining\ncurrent of it; I never knew how far it bore her, or past what happy islands. From the\ntrembling of her face I could well believe that before the last number she had been carried\nout where the myriad graves are, into the grey, nameless burying grounds of the sea; or into\nsome world of death vaster yet, where, from the beginning of the world, hope has lain down\nwith hope and dream with dream and, renouncing, slept. …\nI spoke to my aunt. She burst into tears and sobbed pleadingly. “I don’t want to go,\nClark, I don’t want to go!”\nI understood. For her, just outside the concert hall, lay the black pond with the cattle-\ntracked bluffs; the tall, unpainted house, with weather-curled boards, naked as a tower; the\ncrook-backed ash seedlings where the dish-cloths hung to dry; the gaunt, moulting turkeys\npicking up refuse about the kitchen door.",

        "passage": "In 1973, a book claiming that plants were sentient beings that feel emotions, prefer\nclassical music to rock and roll, and can respond to the unspoken thoughts of humans\nhundreds of miles away landed on the New York Times best-seller list for nonfiction.\n“The Secret Life of Plants,” by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, presented a beguiling\nmashup of legitimate plant science, quack experiments, and mystical nature worship that\ncaptured the public imagination at a time when New Age thinking was seeping into the\nmainstream. The most memorable passages described the experiments of a former C.I.A.\npolygraph expert named Cleve Backster, who, in 1966, on a whim, hooked up a\ngalvanometer to the leaf of a dracaena, a houseplant that he kept in his office. To his\nastonishment, Backster found that simply by imagining the dracaena being set on fire\nhe could make it rouse the needle of the polygraph machine, registering a surge of electrical\nactivity suggesting that the plant felt stress. “Could the plant have been reading his mind?”\nthe authors ask. “Backster felt like running into the street and shouting to the world,\n‘Plants can think!’ ” …\nIn the ensuing years, several legitimate plant scientists tried to reproduce the “Backster\neffect” without success. Much of the science in “The Secret Life of Plants” has been\ndiscredited. But the book had made its mark on the culture. Americans began talking to\ntheir plants and playing Mozart for them, and no doubt many still do. This might seem\nharmless enough; there will probably always be a strain of romanticism running through our\nthinking about plants. (Luther Burbank and George Washington Carver both reputedly\ntalked to, and listened to, the plants they did such brilliant work with.) But in the view of\nmany plant scientists “The Secret Life of Plants” has done lasting damage to their field.\nAccording to Daniel Chamovitz, an Israeli biologist who is the author of the recent book\n“What a Plant Knows,” Tompkins and Bird “stymied important research on plant behavior\nas scientists became wary of any studies that hinted at parallels between animal senses and\nplant senses.” Others contend that “The Secret Life of Plants” led to “self-censorship”\namong researchers seeking to explore the “possible homologies between neurobiology and\nphytobiology”; that is, the possibility that plants are much more intelligent and much more\nlike us than most people think—capable of cognition, communication, information\nprocessing, computation, learning and memory. …\nIndeed, many of the most impressive capabilities of plants can be traced to their unique\nexistential predicament as beings rooted to the ground and therefore unable to pick up and\nmove when they need something or when conditions turn unfavorable. The “sessile life\nstyle,” as plant biologists term it, calls for an extensive and nuanced understanding of one’s\nimmediate environment, since the plant has to find everything it needs, and has to defend\nitself, while remaining fixed in place. A highly developed sensory apparatus is required\nto locate food and identify threats. Plants have evolved between fifteen and twenty distinct\nsenses, including analogues of our five: smell and taste (they sense and respond to\nchemicals in the air or on their bodies); sight (they react differently to various wavelengths\nof light as well as to shadow); touch (a vine or a root “knows” when it encounters a solid\nobject); and, it has been discovered, sound. In a recent experiment, Heidi Appel, a chemical\necologist at the University of Missouri, found that, when she played a recording of \na caterpillar chomping a leaf for a plant that hadn’t been touched, the sound primed the\nplant’s genetic machinery to produce defense chemicals. Another experiment, done in\nMancuso’s lab and not yet published, found that plant roots would seek out a buried pipe\nthrough which water was flowing even if the exterior of the pipe was dry, which suggested\nthat plants somehow “hear” the sound of flowing water. …\nScientists have since found that the tips of the plant roots, in addition to sensing gravity,\nmoisture, light, pressure, and hardness, can also sense volume, nitrogen, phosphorus, salt,\nvarious toxins, microbes, and chemical signals from neighboring plants. Roots about to\nencounter an impenetrable obstacle or a toxic substance change course before they make\ncontact with it. Roots can tell whether nearby roots are self or other and, if other, kin or\nstranger. Normally, plants compete for root space with strangers, but, when researchers put\nfour closely related Great Lakes sea-rocket plants (Cakile edentula) in the same pot,\nthe plants restrained their usual competitive behaviors and shared resources.\nSomehow, a plant gathers and integrates all this information about its environment, and\nthen “decides”—some scientists deploy the quotation marks, indicating metaphor at work;\nothers drop them—in precisely what direction to deploy its roots or its leaves. Once the\ndefinition of “behavior” expands to include such things as a shift in the trajectory of a root,\na reallocation of resources, or the emission of a powerful chemical, plants begin to look like\nmuch more active agents, responding to environmental cues in ways more subtle or\nadaptive than the word “instinct” would suggest. “Plants perceive competitors and grow\naway from them,” Rick Karban, a plant ecologist at U.C. Davis, explained, when I asked him\nfor an example of plant decision-making. “They are more leery of actual vegetation than\nthey are of inanimate objects, and they respond to potential competitors before actually\nbeing shaded by them.” These are sophisticated behaviors, but, like most plant behaviors,\nto an animal they’re either invisible or really, really slow.\nThe sessile life style also helps account for plants’ extraordinary gift for biochemistry,\nwhich far exceeds that of animals and, arguably, of human chemists. (Many drugs, from\naspirin to opiates, derive from compounds designed by plants.) Unable to run away, plants\ndeploy a complex molecular vocabulary to signal distress, deter or poison enemies, and\nrecruit animals to perform various services for them. A recent study in Science found that\nthe caffeine produced by many plants may function not only as a defense chemical, as had\npreviously been thought, but in some cases as a psychoactive drug in their nectar.\nThe caffeine encourages bees to remember a particular plant and return to it, making them\nmore faithful and effective pollinators.\nOne of the most productive areas of plant research in recent years has been plant\nsignalling. Since the early nineteen-eighties, it has been known that when a plant’s leaves\nare infected or chewed by insects they emit volatile chemicals that signal other leaves to\nmount a defense. Sometimes this warning signal contains information about the identity of\nthe insect, gleaned from the taste of its saliva. Depending on the plant and the attacker, the\ndefense might involve altering the leaf’s flavor or texture, or producing toxins or other\ncompounds that render the plant’s flesh less digestible to herbivores. When antelopes\nbrowse acacia trees, the leaves produce tannins that make them unappetizing and difficult\nto digest. When food is scarce and acacias are overbrowsed, it has been reported, the trees\nproduce sufficient amounts of toxin to kill the animals. …\nAll species face the same existential challenges—obtaining food, defending themselves,\nreproducing—but under wildly varying circumstances, and so they have evolved wildly \ndifferent tools in order to survive. Brains come in handy for creatures that move around\na lot; but they’re a disadvantage for ones that are rooted in place. Impressive as it is to us,\nself-consciousness is just another tool for living, good for some jobs, unhelpful for others.\nThat humans would rate this particular adaptation so highly is not surprising, since it has\nbeen the shining destination of our long evolutionary journey, along with the\nepiphenomenon of self-consciousness that we call “free will.” …",

        "passage": "…As we traveled, we entered time and began to trouble it, to pester it apart or into some\nkind of change. On the short nights we sat by firelight and looked at the moon’s long face\non water. Dora-Rouge would lie on the beaver blankets and tell us what place we would\npass on the next day. She’d look at the stars in the shortening night and say, “the Meeting\nPlace,” or “God Island.” True to her word, the next day we reached those places. …\nNow, looking back, I understand how easily we lost track of things. The time we’d been\nteasing apart, unraveled. And now it began to unravel us as we entered a kind of\ntimelessness. Wednesday was the last day we called by name, and truly, we no longer\nneeded time. We were lost from it, and lost in this way, I came alive. It was as if I’d slept\nfor years, and was now awake. The others felt it, too. Cell by cell, all of us were taken in by\nwater and by land, swallowed a little at a time. What we’d thought of as our lives and being\non earth was gone, and now the world was made up of pathways of its own invention.\nWe were only one of the many dreams of earth. And I knew we were just a small dream.\nBut there was a place inside the human that spoke with land, that entered dreaming,\nin the way that people in the north found direction in their dreams. They dreamed\ncharts of land and currents of water. They dreamed where food animals lived. These dreams\nthey called hunger maps and when they followed those maps, they found their prey.\nIt was the language animals and humans had in common. People found their cures in the\nsame way. …\nFor my own part in this dreaming, as soon as I left time, when Thursday and Friday\nslipped away, plants began to cross my restless sleep in abundance. A tendril reached\nthrough darkness, a first sharp leaf came up from the rich ground of my sleeping, opened\nupward from the place in my body that knew absolute truth. It wasn’t a seed that had been\nplanted there, not a cultivated growing, but a wild one, one that had been there all along,\nwaiting. I saw vines creeping forward. Inside the thin lid of an eye, petals opened, and there\nwas pollen at the center of each flower. Field, forest, swamp. I knew how they breathed at\nnight, and that they were linked to us in that breath. It was the oldest bond of survival.\nI was devoted to woods the wind walked through, to mosses and lichens. Somewhere in\nmy past, I had lost the knowing of this opening light of life, the taking up of minerals from\ndark ground, the magnitude of thickets and brush. Now I found it once again. Sleep\nchanged me. I remembered things I’d forgotten, how a hundred years ago, leaves reached\ntoward sunlight, plants bent into currents of water. Something persistent nudged me and it\nhad morning rain on its leaves.\nMaybe the roots of dreaming are in the soil of dailiness, or in the heart, or in another\nplace without words, but when they come together and grow, they are like the seeds of\nhydrogen and the seeds of oxygen that together create ocean, lake, and ice. In this way,\nthe plants and I joined each other. They entangled me in their stems and vines and it was\na beautiful entanglement. …\nSome mornings as we packed our things, set out across water, the world was the color\nof copper, a flood of sun arrived from the east, and a thick mist rose up from black earth.\nOther mornings, heating water over the fire, we’d see the world covered with fog, and\nthe birdsongs sounded forlorn and far away. There were days when we traveled as many as\nthirty miles. Others we traveled no more than ten. There were times when I resented the\nwork, and days I worked so hard even Agnes’ liniment and aspirin would not relax\nmy aching shoulders and I would crave ice, even a single chip of it, cold and shining. On\nother days I felt a deep contentment as I poled inside shallow currents or glided across\na new wide lake.\nWe were in the hands of nature. In these places things turned about and were other\nthan what they seemed. In silence, I pulled through the water and saw how a river appeared\nthrough rolling fog and emptied into the lake. One day, a full-tailed fox moved inside the\nshadows of trees, then stepped into a cloud. New senses came to me. I was equal to the\nother animals, hearing as they heard, moving as they moved, seeing as they saw.\nOne night we stayed on an island close to the decaying, moss-covered pieces of a boat.\nIts remains looked like the ribs of a large animal. In the morning, sun was a dim light\nreaching down through the branches of trees. Pollen floated across the dark water and\ngathered, yellow and life-giving, along the place where water met land. …\nOne evening it seemed cooler. The air had a different feel, rarefied, clean, and thin.\nWolves in the distance were singing and their voices made a sound that seemed to lie upon\nthe land, like a cloud covering the world from one edge of the horizon to the other. We sat\naround the fire and listened, the light on our faces, our eyes soft. Agnes warmed her hands\nover the flames.\nThere was a shorter time of darkness every night, but how beautiful the brief nights, with\nthe stars and the wolves. …\nSometimes I felt there were eyes around us, peering through trees and fog. Maybe it\nwas the eyes of land and creatures regarding us, taking our measure. And listening to the\nnight, I knew there was another horizon, beyond the one we could see. And all of it was\nstoried land, land where deities walked, where people traveled, desiring to be one with\ninfinite space.\nWe were full and powerful, wearing the face of the world, floating in silence.\nDora-Rouge said, “Yes, I believe we’ve always been lost,” as we traveled through thick-\ngrown rushes, marsh, and water so shallow our paddles touched bottom.\nThe four of us became like one animal. We heard inside each other in a tribal way.\nI understood this at once and was easy with it. With my grandmothers, there was no such\nthing as loneliness. Before, my life had been without all its ears, eyes, without all its\nknowings. Now we, the four of us, all had the same eyes, and when Dora-Rouge pointed\na bony finger and said, “This way,” we instinctively followed that crooked finger.\nI never felt lost. I felt newly found, opening, like the tiny eggs we found in a pond one\nday, fertile and transparent. I bent over them. The life was already moving inside them,\nlike an eye or heartbeat. One day we passed alongside cliff walls that bore red, ancient\ndrawings of moose and bear. These were said to have been painted not by humans, but by\nspirits. …",

        "passage": "Jian Lin was 14 years old in 1973, when the Chinese government under Mao Zedong\nrecruited him for a student science team called “the earthquake watchers.” After a series of\nearthquakes that had killed thousands in northern China, the country’s seismologists\nthought that if they augmented their own research by having observers keep an eye out for\nanomalies like snakes bolting early from their winter dens and erratic well-water levels,\nthey might be able to do what no scientific body had managed before: issue an earthquake\nwarning that would save thousands of lives.\nIn the winter of 1974, the earthquake watchers were picking up some suspicious signals\nnear the city of Haicheng. Panicked chickens were squalling and trying to escape their pens;\nwater levels were falling in wells. Seismologists had also begun noticing a telltale pattern of\nsmall quakes. “They were like popcorn kernels,” Lin tells me, “popping up all over the\ngeneral area.” Then, suddenly, the popping stopped, just as it had before a catastrophic\nearthquake in 1966 that killed more than 8,000. “Like ‘the calm before the storm,’ ”\nLin says. “We have that exact same phrase in Chinese.” On the morning of February 4,\n1975, the seismology bureau issued a warning: Haicheng should expect a big earthquake,\nand people should move outdoors.\nAt 7:36 p.m., a magnitude 7.0 quake struck. The city was nearly leveled, but only about\n2,000 people were killed. Without the warning, easily 150,000 would have died. “And so you\nfinally had an earthquake forecast that did indeed save lives,” Lin recalls. “People were\nexcited. Or, you could say, uplifted. Uplifted is a great word for it.” But uplift turned to\nheartbreak the very next year, when a 7.5 quake shattered the city of Tangshan without so\nmuch as a magnitude 4 to introduce it. When the quake hit the city of 1.6 million at 3:42\na.m., it killed nearly 250,000 people, most of whom were asleep. “If there was any moment\nin my life when I was scared of earthquakes, that was it,” Lin says. “You think, what if it\nhappened to you? And it could. I decided that if I could do anything—anything—to save\nlives lost to earthquakes, it would be worth the effort.”\nLin is now a senior scientist of geophysics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,\nin Massachusetts, where he spends his time studying not the scurrying of small animals and\nfluctuating electrical current between trees (another fabled warning sign), but seismometer\nreadings, GPS coordinates, and global earthquake-notification reports. He and his longtime\ncollaborator, Ross Stein of the U.S. Geological Survey, are champions of a theory that could\nenable scientists to forecast earthquakes with more precision and speed.\nSome established geophysicists insist that all earthquakes are random, yet everyone\nagrees that aftershocks are not. Instead, they follow certain empirical laws. Stein, Lin, and\ntheir collaborators hypothesized that many earthquakes classified as main shocks are\nactually aftershocks, and they went looking for the forces that cause faults to fail.\nTheir work was in some ways heretical: For a long time, earthquakes were thought to\nrelease only the stress immediately around them; an earthquake that happened in one\nplace would decrease the possibility of another happening nearby. But that didn’t explain\nearthquake sequences like the one that rumbled through the desert and mountains east of\nLos Angeles in 1992. The series began on April 23 with a 6.2 near the town of Joshua Tree;\ntwo months later, on June 28, a 7.3 struck less than 15 miles away in the desert town of\nLanders. Three and a half hours after that, a 6.5 hit the town of Big Bear, in the mountains\noverlooking the Mojave. The Big Bear quake was timed like an aftershock, except it was too\nfar off the Landers earthquake’s fault rupture. When Lin, Stein, and Geoffrey King of the\nParis Geophysical Institute got together to analyze it, they decided to ignore the distance\nrule and treat it just as a different kind of aftershock. Their ensuing report, “Static Stress\nChanges and the Triggering of Earthquakes,” became one of the decade’s most-cited\nearthquake research papers.\nRocks can be subject to two kinds of stresses: the “clamping” stress that pushes them\ntogether, and the “shear” stress they undergo as they slide past each other. Together, these\nstresses are known as Coulomb stress, named for Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, an 18th-\ncentury French physicist. Coulomb calculations had been used for years in engineering, to\nfind the failure points of various building materials, but they’d never been applied properly\nto faults. It turned out, though, that faults in the ground behave much like rocks in the\nlaboratory: they come unglued when shear stress exceeds the friction and pressure\n(the clamping stress) holding them together. When Stein, Lin, and King applied the\nCoulomb model to the California sequence, they found that most of the earthquakes had\noccurred in areas where the shifting of the ground had caused increased stress.\nIn 1997, Stein and two other geologists using the model found that there was a\n12 percent chance that a magnitude 7 or greater would hit near Izmit, Turkey, within\n30 years; two years later, on August 17, 1999, a magnitude 7.4 destroyed the city, which wasn’t\ndesigned to withstand such a tremor. A Turkish geologist named Aykut Barka quickly wrote\nup a paper warning that Coulomb stress from the Izmit quake could trigger a similar\nrupture near Düzce, a town roughly 60 miles east. His work persuaded authorities there to\nclose school buildings damaged during the Izmit shaking. On November 12, a segment of\nthe North Anatolian Fault gave way, in a magnitude 7.2. The empty school buildings\ncollapsed.\nLin and Stein both admit that Coulomb stress doesn’t explain all earthquakes. Indeed,\nsome geophysicists, like Karen Felzer, of the U.S. Geological Survey, think their hypothesis\ngives short shrift6 to the impact that dynamic stress—the actual rattling of a quake in\nmotion—has on neighboring faults.\nIn the aftermath of the disastrous March 11 To-hoku quake, both camps are looking at\nits well-monitored aftershocks (including several within 100 miles of Tokyo) for answers.\nIntriguingly, it was preceded by a flurry of earthquakes, one as large as magnitude 7.2,\nthat may have been foreshocks, although no one thought so at the time; the researchers are\ntrying to determine what those early quakes meant.\nWhen I ask Lin whether California, where I live, is next, he laughs. “I understand that\nthe public now thinks that we’ve entered a global earthquake cluster. Even my own mother\nin China thinks that. But there’s no scientific evidence whatsoever to suggest that the\nearthquake in New Zealand triggered the earthquake in Japan, or Japan will trigger one in\nCalifornia.” Still, Lin and his colleagues do wonder whether To-hoku has pushed\nneighboring faults closer to rupture. “I am particularly interested in how this earthquake\nmight have changed the potential of future earthquakes to the south, even closer to Tokyo,”\nLin tells me. “There, even a much smaller earthquake could be devastating.”",

        "passage": "It had been noisy and crowded at the Milligan’s and Mrs. Bishop had eaten too many\nlittle sandwiches and too many iced cakes, so that now, out in the street, the air felt good to\nher, even if it was damp and cold. At the entrance of the apartment house, she took out her\nchange purse and looked through it and found that by counting the pennies, too, she had\njust eighty-seven cents, which wasn’t enough for a taxi from Tenth Street to Seventy-Third.\nIt was horrid never having enough money in your purse, she thought. Playing bridge, when\nshe lost, she often had to give I.O.U.’s and it was faintly embarrassing, although she always\nmanaged to make them good. She resented Lila Hardy who could say, “Can anyone change\na ten?” and who could take ten dollars from her small, smart bag while the other women\nscurried about for change.\nShe decided it was too late to take a bus and that she might as well walk over to the\nsubway, although the air down there would probably make her head ache. It was drizzling\na little and the sidewalks were wet. And as she stood on the corner waiting for the traffic\nlights to change, she felt horribly sorry for herself. She remembered as a young girl, she had\nalways assumed she would have lots of money when she was older. She had planned what\nto do with it — what clothes to buy and what upholstery she would have in her car. …\nThe air in the subway was worse than usual and she stood on the local side waiting for\na train. People who took the expresses seemed to push so and she felt tired and wanted to\nsit down. When the train came, she took a seat near the door and, although inwardly she\nwas seething with rebellion, her face took on the vacuous look of other faces in the subway.\nAt Eighteenth Street, a great many people got on and she found her vision blocked by\na man who had come in and was hanging to the strap in front of her. He was tall and thin\nand his overcoat which hung loosely on him and swayed with the motion of the train\nsmelled unpleasantly of damp wool. The buttons of the overcoat were of imitation leather\nand the button directly in front of Mrs. Bishop’s eyes evidently had come off and been\nsewed back on again with black thread, which didn’t match the coat at all.\nIt was what is known as a swagger coat but there was nothing very swagger about it\nnow. The sleeve that she could see was almost threadbare around the cuff and a small shred\nfrom the lining hung down over the man’s hand. She found herself looking intently at his\nhand. It was long and pallid and not too clean. The nails were very short as though they\nhad been bitten and there was a discolored callous on his second finger where he probably\nheld his pencil. Mrs. Bishop, who prided herself on her powers of observation, put him in\nthe white collar class. He most likely, she thought, was the father of a large family and had\na hard time sending them all through school. He undoubtedly never spent money on\nhimself. That would account for the shabbiness of his overcoat. And he was probably\nhorribly afraid of losing his job. His house was always noisy and smelled of cooking.\nMrs. Bishop couldn’t decide whether to make his wife a fat slattern or to have her an \ninvalid. Either would be quite consistent.\nShe grew warm with sympathy for the man. Every now and then he gave a slight cough,\nand that increased her interest and her sadness. It was a soft, pleasant sadness and made\nher feel resigned to life. She decided that she would smile at him when she got off. It would\nbe the sort of smile that couldn’t help but make him feel better, as it would be very obvious\nthat she understood and was sorry.\nBut by the time the train reached Seventy-Second Street, the closeness of the air and\nthe confusion of her own worries had made her feelings less poignant, so that her smile,\nwhen she gave it, lacked something. The man looked away embarrassed. \nHer apartment was too hot and the smell of broiling chops sickened her after\nthe enormous tea she had eaten. She could see Maude, her maid, setting the table in the\ndining-room for dinner. Mrs. Bishop had bought smart little uniforms for her, but there was\nnothing smart about Maude and the uniforms never looked right. …\nFor a minute she stood in the doorway trying to control herself and then she walked\nover to a window and opened it roughly. “Goodness,” she said. “Can’t we ever have any air\nin here?”\nRobert gave a slight start and sat up. “Hello, Mollie,” he said. “You home?”\n“Yes, I’m home,” she answered. “I came home in the subway.”\nHer voice was reproachful. She sat down in the chair facing him and spoke more quietly\nso that Maude couldn’t hear what she was saying. “Really, Robert,” she said, “it was\ndreadful. I came out from the tea in all that drizzle and couldn’t even take a taxi home.\nI had just exactly eighty-seven cents. Just eighty-seven cents!”\n“Say,” he said. “That’s a shame. Here.” He reached in his pocket and took out a small\nroll of crumpled bills. “Here,” he repeated. And handed her one. She saw that it was five\ndollars.\nMrs. Bishop shook her head. “No, Robert,” she told him. “That isn’t the point. The point\nis that I’ve really got to have some sort of allowance. It isn’t fair to me. I never have any\nmoney! Never! It’s got so it’s positively embarrassing!”\nMr. Bishop fingered the five dollar bill thoughtfully. “I see,” he said. “You want an\nallowance. What’s the matter? Don’t I give you money every time you ask for it?”\n“Well, yes,” Mrs. Bishop admitted. “But it isn’t like my own. An allowance would be\nmore like my own.”…\nMr. Bishop sat turning the five dollar bill over and over in his hand. “About how much\ndo you think you should have?” he asked.\n“Fifty dollars a month,” she told him. And her voice was harsh and strained. “That’s the\nvery least I can get along on. Why, Lila Hardy would laugh at fifty dollars a month.”\n“Fifty dollars a month,” Mr. Bishop repeated. He coughed a little, nervously, and\nran his fingers through his hair. “I’ve had a lot of things to attend to this month. But, well,\nmaybe if you would be willing to wait until the first of next month, I might manage.”\n“Oh, next month will be perfectly all right,” she said, feeling it wiser not to press\nher victory. “But don’t forget all about it. Because I shan’t.”\nAs she walked toward the closet to put away her wraps, she caught sight of Robert’s\novercoat on the chair near the door. He had tossed it carelessly across the back of the chair \nas he came in. One sleeve was hanging down and the vibration of her feet on the floor had\nmade it swing gently back and forth. She saw that the cuff was badly worn and a bit of the\nlining showed. It looked dreadfully like the sleeve of the overcoat she had seen in the subway.\nAnd, suddenly, looking at it, she had a horrible sinking feeling, as though she were falling\nin a dream.",

        "passage": "Wherever humans have gone in the world, they have carried with them two things,\nlanguage and fire. As they traveled through tropical forests they hoarded the precious\nembers of old fires and sheltered them from downpours. When they settled the barren\nArctic, they took with them the memory of fire, and recreated it in stoneware vessels filled\nwith animal fat. [Charles] Darwin himself considered these the two most significant\nachievements of humanity. It is, of course, impossible to imagine a human society that does\nnot have language, but—given the right climate and an adequacy of raw wild food—could\nthere be a primitive tribe that survives without cooking? In fact, no such people have ever\nbeen found. Nor will they be, according to a provocative theory by Harvard biologist\nRichard Wrangham, who believes that fire is needed to fuel the organ that makes possible\nall the other products of culture, language included: the human brain.\nEvery animal on earth is constrained by its energy budget; the calories obtained from\nfood will stretch only so far. And for most human beings, most of the time, these calories\nare burned not at the gym, but invisibly, in powering the heart, the digestive system and\nespecially the brain, in the silent work of moving molecules around within and among its\n100 billion cells. A human body at rest devotes roughly one-fifth of its energy to the brain,\nregardless of whether it is thinking anything useful, or even thinking at all. Thus, the\nunprecedented increase in brain size that hominids3 embarked on around 1.8 million years\nago had to be paid for with added calories either taken in or diverted from some other\nfunction in the body. Many anthropologists think the key breakthrough was adding meat to\nthe diet. But Wrangham and his Harvard colleague Rachel Carmody think that’s only a part\nof what was going on in evolution at the time. What matters, they say, is not just how many\ncalories you can put into your mouth, but what happens to the food once it gets there. How\nmuch useful energy does it provide, after subtracting the calories spent in chewing,\nswallowing and digesting? The real breakthrough, they argue, was cooking. …\nFood is a subject on which most people have strong opinions, and Wrangham mostly\nexcuses himself from the moral, political and aesthetic debates it provokes. Impeccably lean\nhimself, he acknowledges blandly that some people will gain weight on the same diet that\nleaves others thin. “Life can be unfair,” he writes in his 2010 book Catching Fire, and his\nshrug is almost palpable4 on the page. He takes no position on the philosophical arguments\nfor and against a raw-food diet, except to point out that it can be quite dangerous for young\nchildren. For healthy adults, it’s “a terrific way to lose weight.”\nWhich is, in a way, his point: Human beings evolved to eat cooked food. It is literally\npossible to starve to death even while filling one’s stomach with raw food. In the wild,\npeople typically survive only a few months without cooking, even if they can obtain meat.\nWrangham cites evidence that urban raw-foodists, despite year-round access to bananas,\nnuts and other high-quality agricultural products, as well as juicers, blenders and\ndehydrators, are often underweight. Of course, they may consider this desirable, but\nWrangham considers it alarming that in one study half the women were malnourished to\nthe point they stopped menstruating. They presumably are eating all they want, and may\neven be consuming what appears to be an adequate number of calories, based on standard\nUSDA [United States Department of Agriculture] tables. There is growing evidence that\nthese overstate, sometimes to a considerable degree, the energy that the body extracts from\nwhole raw foods. Carmody explains that only a fraction of the calories in raw starch and\nprotein are absorbed by the body directly via the small intestine. The remainder passes into\nthe large bowel, where it is broken down by that organ’s ravenous population of microbes,\nwhich consume the lion’s share for themselves. Cooked food, by contrast, is mostly digested\nby the time it enters the colon; for the same amount of calories ingested, the body gets\nroughly 30 percent more energy from cooked oat, wheat or potato starch as compared to\nraw, and as much as 78 percent from the protein in an egg. In Carmody’s experiments,\nanimals given cooked food gain more weight than animals fed the same amount of raw food.\nAnd once they’ve been fed on cooked food, mice, at least, seemed to prefer it.\nIn essence, cooking—including not only heat but also mechanical processes such as\nchopping and grinding—outsources some of the body’s work of digestion so that more\nenergy is extracted from food and less expended in processing it. Cooking breaks down\ncollagen, the connective tissue in meat, and softens the cell walls of plants to release their\nstores of starch and fat. The calories to fuel the bigger brains of successive species of\nhominids came at the expense of the energy-intensive tissue in the gut, which was shrinking\nat the same time—you can actually see how the barrel-shaped trunk of the apes morphed\ninto the comparatively narrow-waisted Homo sapiens. Cooking freed up time, as well; the\ngreat apes spend four to seven hours a day just chewing, not an activity that prioritizes the\nintellect.\nThe trade-off between the gut and the brain is the key insight of the “expensive tissue\nhypothesis,” proposed by Leslie Aiello and Peter Wheeler in 1995. Wrangham credits this\nwith inspiring his own thinking—except that Aiello and Wheeler identified meat-eating as\nthe driver of human evolution, while Wrangham emphasizes cooking. “What could be more\nhuman,” he asks, “than the use of fire?” …\nIn Wrangham’s view, fire did much more than put a nice brown crust on a haunch of\nantelope. Fire detoxifies some foods that are poisonous when eaten raw, and it kills parasites\nand bacteria. Again, this comes down to the energy budget. Animals eat raw food without\ngetting sick because their digestive and immune systems have evolved the appropriate\ndefenses. Presumably the ancestors of Homo erectus—say, Australopithecus—did as well.\nBut anything the body does, even on a molecular level, takes energy; by getting the same\nresults from burning wood, human beings can put those calories to better use in their brains.\nFire, by keeping people warm at night, made fur unnecessary, and without fur hominids\ncould run farther and faster after prey without overheating. Fire brought hominids out of the\ntrees; by frightening away nocturnal predators, it enabled Homo erectus to sleep safely on the\nground, which was part of the process by which bipedalism (and perhaps mind-expanding\ndreaming) evolved. By bringing people together at one place and time to eat, fire laid the\ngroundwork for pair bonding and, indeed, for human society. …",

        "passage": "“That woman’s art-jargon1 tires me,” said Clovis to his journalist friend. “She’s so fond\nof talking of certain pictures as ‘growing on one,’ as though they were a sort of fungus.”\n“That reminds me,” said the journalist, “of the story of Henri Deplis. Have I ever told\nit [to] you?”\nClovis shook his head.\n“Henri Deplis was by birth a native of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. On maturer\nreflection he became a commercial traveller. His business activities frequently took him\nbeyond the limits of the Grand Duchy, and he was stopping in a small town of Northern\nItaly when news reached him from home that a legacy from a distant and deceased relative\nhad fallen to his share.\n“It was not a large legacy, even from the modest standpoint of Henri Deplis, but it\nimpelled him towards some seemingly harmless extravagances. In particular it led him to\npatronise local art as represented by the tattoo-needles of Signor Andreas Pincini. Signor\nPincini was, perhaps, the most brilliant master of tattoo craft that Italy had ever known, but\nhis circumstances were decidedly impoverished, and for the sum of six hundred francs he\ngladly undertook to cover his client’s back, from the collar-bone down to the waistline, with\na glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus. The design, when finally developed, was a\nslight disappointment to Monsieur Deplis, who had suspected Icarus of being a fortress\ntaken by Wallenstein in the Thirty Years’ War, but he was more than satisfied with the\nexecution of the work, which was acclaimed by all who had the privilege of seeing it as\nPincini’s masterpiece.\n“It was his greatest effort, and his last. Without even waiting to be paid, the illustrious\ncraftsman departed this life, and was buried under an ornate tombstone, whose winged\ncherubs would have afforded singularly little scope for the exercise of his favourite art.\nThere remained, however, the widow Pincini, to whom the six hundred francs were due.\nAnd thereupon arose the great crisis in the life of Henri Deplis, traveller of commerce. The\nlegacy, under the stress of numerous little calls on its substance, had dwindled to very\ninsignificant proportions, and when a pressing wine bill and sundry other current accounts\nhad been paid, there remained little more than 430 francs to offer to the widow. The lady\nwas properly indignant, not wholly, as she volubly explained, on account of the suggested\nwriting-off of 170 francs, but also at the attempt to depreciate the value of her late\nhusband’s acknowledged masterpiece. In a week’s time Deplis was obliged to reduce his\noffer to 405 francs, which circumstance fanned the widow’s indignation into a fury. She\ncancelled the sale of the work of art, and a few days later Deplis learned with a sense of\nconsternation that she had presented it to the municipality of Bergamo, which had\ngratefully accepted it. He left the neighbourhood as unobtrusively as possible, and was\ngenuinely relieved when his business commands took him to Rome, where he hoped his\nidentity and that of the famous picture might be lost sight of.\n“But he bore on his back the burden of the dead man’s genius. On presenting himself one\nday in the steaming corridor of a vapour bath, he was at once hustled back into his clothes\nby the proprietor, who was a North Italian, and who emphatically refused to allow the\ncelebrated Fall of Icarus to be publicly on view without the permission of the municipality\nof Bergamo. Public interest and official vigilance increased as the matter became more\nwidely known, and Deplis was unable to take a simple dip in the sea or river on the hottest\nafternoon unless clothed up to the collar-bone in a substantial bathing garment. Later on\nthe authorities of Bergamo conceived the idea that salt water might be injurious to the\nmasterpiece, and a perpetual injunction was obtained which debarred the muchly harassed\ncommercial traveller from sea bathing under any circumstances. Altogether, he was\nfervently thankful when his firm of employers found him a new range of activities in the\nneighbourhood of Bordeaux. His thankfulness, however, ceased abruptly at the Franco-\nItalian frontier. An imposing array of official force barred his departure, and he was sternly\nreminded of the stringent law, which forbids the exportation of Italian works of art.\n“A diplomatic parley ensued between the Luxemburgian and Italian Governments, and\nat one time the European situation became overcast with the possibilities of trouble. But\nthe Italian Government stood firm; it declined to concern itself in the least with the\nfortunes or even the existence of Henri Deplis, commercial traveller, but was immovable in\nits decision that the Fall of Icarus (by the late Pincini, Andreas) at present the property of\nthe municipality of Bergamo, should not leave the country. …\n“Meanwhile, the unhappy human background fared no better than before, and it was\nnot surprising that he drifted into the ranks of Italian anarchists. Four times at least he was\nescorted to the frontier as a dangerous and undesirable foreigner, but he was always\nbrought back as the Fall of Icarus (attributed to Pincini, Andreas, early Twentieth Century).\nAnd then one day, at an anarchist congress at Genoa, a fellow-worker, in the heat of debate,\nbroke a phial full of corrosive liquid over his back.

        "passage": "“That woman’s art-jargon1 tires me,” said Clovis to his journalist friend. “She’s so fond\nof talking of certain pictures as ‘growing on one,’ as though they were a sort of fungus.”\n“That reminds me,” said the journalist, “of the story of Henri Deplis. Have I ever told\nit [to] you?”\nClovis shook his head.\n“Henri Deplis was by birth a native of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. On maturer\nreflection he became a commercial traveller. His business activities frequently took him\nbeyond the limits of the Grand Duchy, and he was stopping in a small town of Northern\nItaly when news reached him from home that a legacy from a distant and deceased relative\nhad fallen to his share.\n“It was not a large legacy, even from the modest standpoint of Henri Deplis, but it\nimpelled him towards some seemingly harmless extravagances. In particular it led him to\npatronise local art as represented by the tattoo-needles of Signor Andreas Pincini. Signor\nPincini was, perhaps, the most brilliant master of tattoo craft that Italy had ever known, but\nhis circumstances were decidedly impoverished, and for the sum of six hundred francs he\ngladly undertook to cover his client’s back, from the collar-bone down to the waistline, with\na glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus. The design, when finally developed, was a\nslight disappointment to Monsieur Deplis, who had suspected Icarus of being a fortress\ntaken by Wallenstein in the Thirty Years’ War, but he was more than satisfied with the\nexecution of the work, which was acclaimed by all who had the privilege of seeing it as\nPincini’s masterpiece.\n“It was his greatest effort, and his last. Without even waiting to be paid, the illustrious\ncraftsman departed this life, and was buried under an ornate tombstone, whose winged\ncherubs would have afforded singularly little scope for the exercise of his favourite art.\nThere remained, however, the widow Pincini, to whom the six hundred francs were due.\nAnd thereupon arose the great crisis in the life of Henri Deplis, traveller of commerce. The\nlegacy, under the stress of numerous little calls on its substance, had dwindled to very\ninsignificant proportions, and when a pressing wine bill and sundry other current accounts\nhad been paid, there remained little more than 430 francs to offer to the widow. The lady\nwas properly indignant, not wholly, as she volubly explained, on account of the suggested\nwriting-off of 170 francs, but also at the attempt to depreciate the value of her late\nhusband’s acknowledged masterpiece. In a week’s time Deplis was obliged to reduce his\noffer to 405 francs, which circumstance fanned the widow’s indignation into a fury. She\ncancelled the sale of the work of art, and a few days later Deplis learned with a sense of\nconsternation that she had presented it to the municipality of Bergamo, which had\ngratefully accepted it. He left the neighbourhood as unobtrusively as possible, and was\ngenuinely relieved when his business commands took him to Rome, where he hoped his\nidentity and that of the famous picture might be lost sight of.\n“But he bore on his back the burden of the dead man’s genius. On presenting himself one\nday in the steaming corridor of a vapour bath, he was at once hustled back into his clothes\nby the proprietor, who was a North Italian, and who emphatically refused to allow the\ncelebrated Fall of Icarus to be publicly on view without the permission of the municipality\nof Bergamo. Public interest and official vigilance increased as the matter became more\nwidely known, and Deplis was unable to take a simple dip in the sea or river on the hottest\nafternoon unless clothed up to the collar-bone in a substantial bathing garment. Later on\nthe authorities of Bergamo conceived the idea that salt water might be injurious to the\nmasterpiece, and a perpetual injunction was obtained which debarred the muchly harassed\ncommercial traveller from sea bathing under any circumstances. Altogether, he was\nfervently thankful when his firm of employers found him a new range of activities in the\nneighbourhood of Bordeaux. His thankfulness, however, ceased abruptly at the Franco-\nItalian frontier. An imposing array of official force barred his departure, and he was sternly\nreminded of the stringent law, which forbids the exportation of Italian works of art.\n“A diplomatic parley ensued between the Luxemburgian and Italian Governments, and\nat one time the European situation became overcast with the possibilities of trouble. But\nthe Italian Government stood firm; it declined to concern itself in the least with the\nfortunes or even the existence of Henri Deplis, commercial traveller, but was immovable in\nits decision that the Fall of Icarus (by the late Pincini, Andreas) at present the property of\nthe municipality of Bergamo, should not leave the country. …\n“Meanwhile, the unhappy human background fared no better than before, and it was\nnot surprising that he drifted into the ranks of Italian anarchists. Four times at least he was\nescorted to the frontier as a dangerous and undesirable foreigner, but he was always\nbrought back as the Fall of Icarus (attributed to Pincini, Andreas, early Twentieth Century).\nAnd then one day, at an anarchist congress at Genoa, a fellow-worker, in the heat of debate,\nbroke a phial full of corrosive liquid over his back. The red shirt that he was wearing\nmitigated the effects, but the Icarus was ruined beyond recognition. His assailant was\nseverely reprimanded for assaulting a fellow-anarchist and received seven years’\nimprisonment for defacing a national art treasure. As soon as he was able to leave the\nhospital Henri Deplis was put across the frontier as an undesirable alien.\n“In the quieter streets of Paris, especially in the neighbourhood of the Ministry of Fine\nArts, you may sometimes meet a depressed, anxious-looking man, who, if you pass him the\ntime of day, will answer you with a slight Luxemburgian accent. He nurses the illusion that\nhe is one of the lost arms of the Venus de Milo, and hopes that the French Government\nmay be persuaded to buy him. On all other subjects I believe he is tolerably sane.”",

        "passage": "When my mother found out that the large mirror in the living room was inhabited,\nwe all gradually went from disbelief to astonishment, and from this to a state of\ncontemplation, ending up by accepting it as an everyday thing.\nThe fact that the old, spotted mirror reflected the dear departed in the family was not\nenough to upset our life style. Following the old saying of “let the house burn as long as\nno one sees the smoke,” we kept the secret to ourselves since, after all, it was nobody else’s\nbusiness.\nAt any rate, some time went by before each one of us would feel absolutely comfortable\nabout sitting down in our favorite chair and learning that, in the mirror, that same chair was\noccupied by somebody else. For example, it could be Aurelia, my grandmother’s sister\n(1939), and even if cousin Natalie would be on my side of the room, across from her would\nbe the almost forgotten Uncle Nicholas (1927). As could have been expected, our departed\nreflected in the mirror presented the image of a family gathering almost identical to our\nown, since nothing, absolutely nothing in the living-room—the furniture and its\narrangement, the light, etc.—was changed in the mirror. The only difference was that on\nthe other side it was them instead of us.\nI don’t know about the others, but I sometimes felt that, more than a vision in the\nmirror, I was watching an old worn-out movie, already clouded. The deceaseds’ efforts to\ncopy our gestures were slower, restrained, as if the mirror were not truly showing a direct\nimage but the reflection of some other reflection.\nFrom the very beginning I knew that everything would get more complicated as soon\nas my cousin Clara got back from vacation. Because of her boldness and determination,\nClara had long given me the impression that she had blundered into our family by mistake.\nThis suspicion had been somewhat bolstered by her being one of the first women dentists\nin the country. However, the idea that she might have been with us by mistake went away\nas soon as my cousin hung up her diploma and started to embroider sheets beside my\ngrandmother, aunts and other cousins, waiting for a suitor who actually did show up but was\nfound lacking in one respect or another—nobody ever really found out why.\nOnce she graduated, Clara became the family oracle, even though she never practiced her\nprofession. She would prescribe painkillers and was the arbiter of fashion; she would choose\nthe theater shows and rule on whether the punch had the right amount of liquor at each social\ngathering. In view of all this, it was fitting that she take one month off every year to go to the\nbeach. …\nNaturally, the idea of moving the mirror to the dining-room was hers. And so was its\nsequel: to bring the mirror near the big table, so we could all sit together for meals.\nIn spite of my mother’s fears that the mirror people would run away or get annoyed\nbecause of the fuss, everything went fine. I must admit it was comforting to sit every day\nat the table and see so many familiar faces, although some of those from the other side were\ndistant relatives, and others, due to their lengthy—although unintentional—absence, were \nalmost strangers. There were about twenty of us sitting at the table every day, and even if\ntheir gestures and movements seemed more remote than ours and their meals a little\nwashed-out, we generally gave the impression of being a large family that got along well. …\nFor a while we ate all together, without further incidents or problems. We mustn’t\nforget Clara, however, whom we had allowed to sit at the frontier between the two tables,\nthe equator separating what was from what was not. Although we paid no attention to\nthe situation, we should have. Compounding our regrettable oversight was the fact that\nlethargic Eulalia sat across from her so that one night, with the same cordiality with which\nshe had addressed Gus [a family member], Clara asked Eulalia to pass the salad. Eulalia\naffected the haughty disdain of offended royalty as she passed the spectral salad bowl,\nfilled with dull lettuce and grayish semi-transparent tomatoes which Clara gobbled up,\nsmiling mischievously at the novelty of it all. She watched us with the same defiance in\nher eyes that she had on the day she enrolled in a man’s subject. There was no time to act.\nWe just watched her grow pale, then her smile faded away until finally Clara collapsed\nagainst the mirror.\nOnce the funeral business was over and we sat back down at the table again, we saw that\nClara had taken a place on the other side. She was between cousin Baltazar (1940) and a\ngreat-uncle whom we simply called “Ito.”\nThis faux pas dampened our conviviality somewhat. In a way, we felt betrayed; we felt\nthat they had grievously abused our hospitality. However, we ended up divided over the\nquestion of who was really whose guest. It was also plain that our carelessness and Clara’s\nirrepressible inquisitiveness had contributed to the mishap. In fact, a short time later we\nrealized that there wasn’t a great deal of difference between what Clara did before and\nwhat she was doing now, and so we decided to overlook the incident and get on with things.\nNevertheless, each day we became less and less sure about which side was life and which\nits reflection, and as one bad step leads to another, I ended up taking Clara’s empty place.\nI am now much closer to them. I can almost hear the distant rustle of the folding and\nunfolding of napkins, the slight clinking of glasses and cutlery, the movement of chairs.\nThe fact is that I can’t tell if these sounds come from them or from us. I’m obviously not\nworried about clearing that up. What really troubles me, though, is that Clara doesn’t seem\nto behave properly, with either the solemnity or with the opacity owed to her new position;\nI don’t know how to put it. Even worse, the problem is that I—more than anybody else in\nthe family—may become the target of Clara’s machinations, since we were always joined\nby a very special affection, perhaps because we were the same age and had shared the same\nchildren’s games and the first anxieties of adolescence…\nAs it happens, she is doing her best to get my attention, and ever since last Monday she\nhas been waiting for me to slip up so she can pass me a pineapple this big, admittedly a little\nbleached-out, but just right for making juice and also a bit sour, just as she knows I like it.",

In the day-time you felt that you had got high up, near to the sun, but the early\nmornings and evenings were limpid and restful, and the nights were cold. …\nWe grew coffee on my farm. The land was in itself a little too high for coffee, and it was\nhard work to keep it going; we were never rich on the farm. But a coffee-plantation is a\nthing that gets hold of you and does not let you go, and there is always something to do on\nit: you are generally just a little behind with your work. …\nCoffee-growing is a long job. It does not all come out as you imagine, when, yourself\nyoung and hopeful, in the streaming rain, you carry the boxes of your shining young coffee-\nplants from the nurseries, and, with the whole number of farm-hands in the field, watch the\nplants set in the regular rows of holes in the wet ground where they are to grow, and\nthen have them thickly shaded against the sun, with branches broken from the bush,\nsince obscurity is the privilege of young things. It is four or five years till the trees come into\nbearing, and in the meantime you will get drought on the land, or diseases, and the bold\nnative weeds will grow up thick in the fields,—the black-jack, which has long scabrous\nseed-vessels that hang on to your clothes and stockings. Some of the trees have been badly\nplanted with their tap-roots bent; they will die just as they begin to flower. You plant a little\nover six hundred trees to the acre, and I had six hundred acres of land with coffee; my oxen\ndragged the cultivators up and down the fields, between the rows of trees, many thousand\nmiles, patiently, awaiting coming bounties.\nThere are times of great beauty on a coffee-farm. When the plantation flowered in\nthe beginning of the rains, it was a radiant sight, like a cloud of chalk, in the mist and\nthe drizzling rain, over six hundred acres of land. The coffee-blossom has a delicate slightly\nbitter scent, like the black-thorn blossom. When the field reddened with the ripe berries,\nall the women and the children, whom they call the Totos, were called out to pick the coffee\noff the trees, together with the men; then the waggons and carts brought it down to the\nfactory near the river. Our machinery was never quite what it should have been, but we had\nplanned and built the factory ourselves and thought highly of it. Once the whole factory\nburned down and had to be built up again. The big coffee-dryer turned and turned,\nrumbling the coffee in its iron belly with a sound like pebbles that are washed about on the\nsea-shore. Sometimes the coffee would be dry, and ready to take out of the dryer, in the\nmiddle of the night. That was a picturesque moment, with many hurricane lamps in the\nhuge dark room of the factory, that was hung everywhere with cobwebs and coffee-husks,\nand with eager glowing dark faces, in the light of the lamps, round the dryer; the factory,\nyou felt, hung in the great African night like a bright jewel in an Ethiope’s ear. Later on the\ncoffee was hulled, graded, and sorted by hand, and packed in sacks sewn up with a saddler’s\nneedle. …\nMy farm was a little too high up for growing coffee. It happened in the cold months that\nwe would get frost on the lower land and in the morning the shoots of the coffee-trees, and\nthe young coffee-berries on them, would be all brown and withered. The wind blew in from\nthe plains, and even in good years we never got the same yield of coffee to the acre as the\npeople in the lower districts of Thika and Kiambu, on four thousand feet. \nWe were short of rain, as well, in the Ngong country, and three times we had a year of\nreal drought, which brought us very low down. In a year in which we had fifty inches of rain,\nwe picked eighty tons of coffee, and in a year of fifty-five inches, nearly ninety tons;\nbut there were two bad years in which we had only twenty-five and twenty inches of rain, and\npicked only sixteen and fifteen tons of coffee, and those years were disastrous to the\nfarm.\n50 At the same time coffee-prices fell: where we had got a hundred pounds a ton we now\ngot sixty or seventy. Times grew hard on the farm. We could not pay our debts, and we had\nno money for the running of the plantation. My people at home, who had shares in the farm,\nwrote out to me and told me that I would have to sell. …\nOur real trouble was that we were short of capital, for it had all been spent in the old\ndays before I took over the running of the farm. We could not carry through any radical\nimprovements, but had to live from hand to mouth,—and this, in the last years, became our\nnormal mode of living on the farm. …\nWhen I had no more money, and could not make things pay, I had to sell the farm.\nA big Company in Nairobi bought it. They thought that the place was too high up for coffee,\nand they were not going in for farming. But they meant to take up all the coffee-trees, to\ndivide up the land and lay out roads, and in time, when Nairobi should be growing out to\nthe West, they meant to sell the land for building-plots. That was towards the end of the\nyear.\nEven as it was then, I do not think that I should have found it in me to give up the farm\nif it had not been for one thing. The coffee-crop that was still unripe upon the trees\nbelonged to the old owners of the farm, or to the Bank which was holding a first mortgage\nin it. This coffee would not be picked, handled in the factory and sent off, till May or later.\nFor such a period I was to remain on the farm, in charge of it, and things were to go on,\nunaltered to the view. And during this time, I thought, something would happen to change\nit all back, since the world, after all, was not a regular or calculable place. …",

        "passage": "…It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat, the hairs in his nostrils\nwebbed into instant ice, his eyes stung and watered. In the faint starlight and the bluish\nluminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without\ndepth, glimmering with things half seen or imagined. Beside the dead car he stood with his\nhead bent, listening, and there was not a sound. Everything on the planet might have died\nin the cold. …\nBut here he stood in light overcoat and thin leather gloves, without overshoes, and his\ncar all but blocked the road, and the door could not be locked, and there was not a\npossibility that he could carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village. He\nswitched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed, and saw a rail\nfence, with cedars and spruces behind it. When more complex gadgets and more complex\ncures failed, there was always the lucifer match.\nTen minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his\nback against the plowed snowbank, digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and\ngloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire. He had a supply of fence rails good\nfor an hour. In that time, someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow. In\nthis country, in winter, no one ever passed up a stranded motorist. …\nAbruptly he did not want to wait in that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer. The\nsample cases could look after themselves, any motorist who passed could take his own\nchances. He would walk ahead to the nearest help, and if he found himself getting too cold\non the way, he could always build another fire. The thought of action cheered him; he\nadmitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold. …\nTurning with the road, he passed through the stretch of woods and came into the open\nto see the moon-white, shadow-black buildings of a farm, and the weak bloom of light in a\nwindow. …\n“Hello?” he said, and knocked again. “Anybody home?” No sound answered him. He\nsaw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves. His numb hand ached with the pain\nof knocking; he pounded with the soft edge of his fist.\nAnswer finally came, not from the door before which he stood, but from the barn, down\nat the end of a staggered string of attached sheds. A door creaked open against a snowbank\nand a figure with a lantern appeared, stood for a moment, and came running. The traveler\nwondered at the way it came, lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow, until it arrived at\nthe porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve. The boy set his lantern on the\nporch; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw and the down-pulled stocking cap his\nface was a pinched whiteness, his eyes enormous. He stared at the traveler until the traveler\nbecame aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders, and began to laugh. \n“My car stopped on me, a mile or so up the road,” he said. “I was just hunting a\ntelephone or some place where I could get help.”\nThe boy swallowed, wiped the back of his mitt across his nose. “Grandpa’s sick!” he\nblurted, and opened the door. …\n“He must’ve had a shock,” the boy said. “I came in from chores and he was on the floor.”\nHe stared at the mummy under the quilt, and he swallowed. …\n“Why didn’t you go for help?”\nThe boy looked down, ashamed. “It’s near two miles. I was afraid he’d.…”\n“But you left him. You were out in the barn.”\n“I was hitching up to go,” the boy said. “I’d made up my mind.”\nThe traveler backed away from the stove, his face smarting with the heat, his fingers\nand feet beginning to ache. He looked at the old man and knew that here, as at the car, he\nwas helpless. The boy’s thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had\nbeen swallowed up in this other one. He had been altered from a man in need of help to\none who must give it. Salesman of wonder cures, he must now produce something to calm\nthis over-worried boy, restore a dying man. Rebelliously, victimized by circumstances, he\nsaid, “Where were you going for help?”\n“The Hill place. They’ve got a phone.”\n“How far are they from a town?”\n“About five miles.”\n“Doctor there?”\n“Yes.”\n“If I took your horse and—what is it, sleigh?—could someone at the Hills’ bring them\nback, do you think?”\n“Cutter. One of the Hill boys could, I should say.”\n“Or would you rather go, while I look after your Grandpa?”\n“He don’t know you,” the boy said directly. “If he should wake up he might … wonder\n… it might.…”\nThe traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the\nboy did the work. And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know\nhow it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face\nof an utter stranger. “Yes,” he said. “Well, I could call the doctor from the Hills’. Two miles,\ndid you say?” …\nHe climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found\nthere; the scallop of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door. The horses breathed jets\nof steam in the moonlight, restlessly moving, jingling their harness bells, as the moment\nlengthened itself. The traveler saw how the boy, now that his anxiety was somewhat quieted,\nnow that he had been able to unload part of his burden, watched him with a thousand\nquestions in his face, and he remembered how he himself, thirty years ago, had searched\nthe faces of passing strangers for something he could not name, how he had listened to their\nsteps and seen their shadows lengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable\nplaces, and how he had ached with the desire to know them, who they were. But none of\nthem had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy. … \nFor half a breath he was utterly bewitched, frozen at the heart of some icy dream.\nAbruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses; the cutter jerked and then slid\nsmoothly out toward the road. The traveler looked back once, to fix forever the picture of\nhimself standing silently watching himself go. As he slid into the road the horses broke into\na trot. The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to\npull the hairy, wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face.\nAlong a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm and an\nunknown town, to distribute according to some wise law part of the burden of the boy’s\nemergency and his own; but he bore in his mind, bright as moonlight over snow, a vivid\nwonder, almost an awe. For from that most chronic and incurable of ills, identity, he had\nlooked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself.",

        "passage": "…Nowhere is light pollution more apparent, almost achingly so, than in satellite images\nof the Earth from space. The continental United States seems to split in half: the eastern\nside is brighter than the west, except for the klieg lights of Las Vegas. Highways innervate\nAmerica, connecting luminous dots of small towns and big cities. Across the Atlantic,\nEurope shimmers. Moscow is a radiant nine-pointed star. The Nile Delta glows like a\ndandelion sprouting from mostly indigo Africa. Farther east, Hong Kong and Shanghai are\nablaze, and the demilitarised zone separates dark North Korea from South Korea more\ncleanly than if the peninsula had been cleft in two. Developed society, it’s clear, is where the\nlight is.\nHuman-controlled light has pierced the night for thousands of years, long before\n[Thomas] Edison. Campfires warmed our ancestors’ feet and cooked their meals; the\nHarvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues in his book Catching Fire (2009) that\ngathering around a flame to eat and to commune with others is, in fact, what made us\nhuman. Not just fellowship but safety has long been the primary rationale for pushing back\nthe night. ‘Evil spirits love not the smell of lamps,’ as Plato put it. Comforting, lambent\nlamplight led us safely home by tattling on the people and potholes and animals that would\notherwise do us harm. By the early 17th century, residents of cities such as Paris and London\nwere admonished to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets,\nas the historian A. Roger Ekirch notes in his book At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past\n(2005). Taxpayers funded oil lamps and candlelit lanterns for the avenues, while only\ngenteel households could afford fine beeswax or spermaceti candles; most people relied on\ntallow, made from animal fat. …\nAnd even so — what price safety! A young but rapidly growing field of research suggests\nthat night-time light itself is far more dangerous than the dark. In a 2012 report, an\nAmerican Medical Association committee called electric lighting a ‘man-made self-\nexperiment’ creating potentially harmful health effects. Humans, and everything else that\nlives on this planet with us, evolved during billions of years along a reliable cycle of day and\nnight, with clear boundaries between them. Staunching the flood of artificial light can help\nrestore this divide. Our well-being, and that of our fellow creatures, might depend on us\ndoing so — or at the very least trying. The loss of night-time darkness neglects our shared\npast, but it might very well cut short our futures too. …\nA growing body of evidence shows that light pollution exacerbates, and might directly\ncause, cancer, obesity, and depression, the troublesome triumvirate of industrialised\nsociety. One of the first people to notice this correlation, at least as it applies to cancer, is\nRichard Stevens, a professor at the University of Connecticut, respected cancer\nepidemiologist, and mild insomniac. In the early 1980s, Stevens and other researchers\nwere beginning to realise there was little or no connection between diet and rising rates of \nbreast cancer, contrary to what had been suspected. As Stevens puts it, it was like a light\nbulb going on when he realised that, in fact, a light bulb going on might be a culprit. …\n‘Rather than falling, night, to the watchful eye, rises,’ writes Ekirch in At Day’s Close.\nShadows creep up lows and valleys first, then consume hillsides and houses and the tallest\nbuildings. Muted greys and deeper blues chase off the sun until finally the sky leaks no\ncolour. When we sleep according to a solar cycle, melatonin production follows this\npattern, rising with the night. But artificial light tamps it down. This is frustratingly\napparent for a special class of humans who experience sunsets every 90 minutes: astronauts.\nOne of the most frequent complaints of orbital crew members is insomnia; they pop\nsleeping pills on a regular basis, and still get only about six hours of shuteye, though they’re\nallotted eight. Steven W. Lockley, a Harvard neuroscientist, recommends altering the light\nto improve matters. In 2012, he advised NASA [National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration] engineers to change the light bulbs on the International Space Station to a\ntype of LED that can display blue-shifted light during the ‘day’, when the crew is working,\nand red-shifted light when they need to rest. Why the difference? That crucial ganglion,\nthe circadian photoreceptor, is particularly sensitive to light toward the bluish end of the\nred, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet visible-light spectrum. …\nInsomnia is hardly the worst side effect of light pollution. Shift workers, who rise with\nthe night and work awash in blue light, experience not only disrupted circadian rhythms and\nsleep deprivation, but an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. These cancers, which\nrequire hormones to grow, are suppressed in the presence of melatonin, Stevens has shown.\nIn 2010, Stevens published a review of breast cancer sensitivity in 164 countries, and found\na 30 to 50 per cent increased risk of cancer in nations with the worst light pollution, but no\nincreased prevalence of non-hormonally dependent cancers in the same populations.\n‘Our use of electric light in the modern world is disrupting our circadian sleep and our\nbiology. There is no question about that. Does that have physiological consequences? There\nis more and more evidence that it does,’ Stevens told me. ‘The epidemiological studies are\nthe crudest, but the most important.’ …\nWhen we, in the industrialised world, do manage to turn off the lights, there are\nmeasurable, beneficial effects on our circadian rhythms. In a widely reported paper last\nsummer, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado at Boulder took eight students\ncamping in the Rocky Mountains for two weeks. They weren’t allowed to use any artificial\nlight after the sun went down — only the sanguine10 glow of campfire. After a week,\nmelatonin started to rise at sunset, peak in the middle of the night, and taper just at sunrise,\nwhich Wright called a ‘remarkable’ result. ‘Internal biological time under natural light-dark\nconditions tightly synchronises to environmental time, and in this regard, humans are\ncomparable to other animals,’ he wrote. …\nFor those of us addicted to our glowing phones and tablets, an app called F.lux can help.\nIt ‘warms’ your device’s display screen so that it shifts red in the evening, more closely\nmatching incandescent bulbs and the hue of the setting sun. Just a brief glimpse at your\nmobile phone at bedtime is enough to expose your retinas to artificial light, so fighting such \na comprehensive intrusion might be an exercise in futility. But even if we can’t completely\nquench our thirst for light, we can all make one small gesture, which could prompt us to\nunplug a little more. …",

        "passage": "When Marvin was ten years old, his father took him through the long, echoing corridors\nthat led up through Administration and Power, until at last they came to the uppermost\nlevels of all and were among the swiftly growing vegetation of the Farmlands. Marvin liked\nit here: it was fun watching the great, slender plants creeping with almost visible eagerness\ntowards the sunlight as it filtered down through the plastic domes to meet them. The smell\nof life was everywhere, awakening inexpressible longings in his heart: no longer was he\nbreathing the dry, cool air of the residential levels, purged of all smells but the faint tang of\nozone. He wished he could stay here for a little while, but Father would not let him. They\nwent onwards until they had reached the entrance to the Observatory, which he had never\nvisited: but they did not stop, and Marvin knew with a sense of rising excitement that there\ncould be only one goal left. For the first time in his life, he was going Outside.\nThere were a dozen of the surface vehicles, with their wide balloon tyres [tires] and\npressurized cabins, in the great servicing chamber. His father must have been expected, for\nthey were led at once to the little scout car waiting by the huge circular door of the airlock.\nTense with expectancy, Marvin settled himself down in the cramped cabin while his father\nstarted the motor and checked the controls. The inner door of the lock slid open and then\nclosed behind them: he heard the roar of the great air-pumps fade slowly away as the\npressure dropped to zero. Then the ‘Vacuum’ sign flashed on, the outer door parted, and\nbefore Marvin lay the land which he had never yet entered.\nHe had seen it in photographs, of course: he had watched it imaged on television\nscreens a hundred times. But now it was lying all around him, burning beneath the fierce\nsun that crawled so slowly across the jet-black sky. He stared into the west, away from the\nblinding splendour of the sun — and there were the stars, as he had been told but had never\nquite believed. He gazed at them for a long time, marvelling that anything could be so bright\nand yet so tiny. They were intense unscintillating points, and suddenly he remembered a\nrhyme he had once read in one of his father’s books:\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are.\nWell, he knew what the stars were. Whoever asked that question must have been very\nstupid. And what did they mean by ‘twinkle’? You could see at a glance that all the stars\nshone with the same steady, unwavering light. He abandoned the puzzle and turned his\nattention to the landscape around him.\nThey were racing across a level plain at almost a hundred miles an hour, the great\nballoon tyres sending up little spurts of dust behind them. There was no sign of the Colony:\nin the few minutes while he had been gazing at the stars, its domes and radio towers had\nfallen below the horizon. Yet there were other indications of man’s presence, for about a\nmile ahead Marvin could see the curiously shaped structures clustering round the head of \na mine. Now and then a puff of vapour would emerge from a squat smoke-stack and would\ninstantly disperse.\nThey were past the mine in a moment: Father was driving with a reckless and\nexhilarating skill as if — it was a strange thought to come into a child’s mind — he was\ntrying to escape from something. In a few minutes they had reached the edge of the plateau\non which the Colony had been built. The ground fell sharply away beneath them in a\ndizzying slope whose lower stretches were lost in shadow. Ahead, as far as the eye could\nreach, was a jumbled wasteland of craters, mountain ranges, and ravines. The crests of the\nmountains, catching the low sun, burned like islands of fire in a sea of darkness: and above\nthem the stars still shone as steadfastly as ever. …\nAnd now on the right was a wrinkled, dusty plain, and on the left, its ramparts and\nterraces rising mile after mile into the sky, was a wall of mountains that marched into the\ndistance until its peaks sank from sight below the rim of the world. There was no sign that\nmen had ever explored this land, but once they passed the skeleton of a crashed rocket, and\nbeside it a stone cairn surmounted by a metal cross. …\nThe sun was now low behind the hills on the right: the valley before them should be in\ntotal darkness. Yet it was awash with a cold white radiance that came spilling over the crags\nbeneath which they were driving. Then, suddenly, they were out in the open plain, and the\nsource of the light lay before them in all its glory.\nIt was very quiet in the little cabin now that the motors had stopped. The only sound\nwas the faint whisper of the oxygen feed and an occasional metallic crepitation as the outer\nwalls of the vehicle radiated away their heat. For no warmth at all came from the great silver\ncrescent that floated low above the far horizon and flooded all this land with pearly light. It\nwas so brilliant that minutes passed before Marvin could accept its challenge and look\nsteadfastly into its glare, but at last he could discern the outlines of continents, the hazy\nborder of the atmosphere, and the white islands of cloud. And even at this distance, he\ncould see the glitter of sunlight on the polar ice.\nIt was beautiful, and it called to his heart across the abyss of space. There in that shining\ncrescent were all the wonders that he had never known — the hues of sunset skies, the\nmoaning of the sea on pebbled shores, the patter of falling rain, the unhurried benison of\nsnow. These and a thousand others should have been his rightful heritage, but he knew\nthem only from the books and ancient records, and the thought filled him with the anguish\nof exile.\nWhy could they not return? It seemed so peaceful beneath those lines of marching\ncloud. Then Marvin, his eyes no longer blinded by the glare, saw that the portion of the disk\nthat should have been in darkness was gleaming faintly with an evil phosphorescence: and\nhe remembered. He was looking upon the funeral pyre of a world — upon the radioactive\naftermath of Armageddon. Across a quarter of a million miles of space, the glow of dying\natoms was still visible, a perennial reminder of the ruined past. It would be centuries yet\nbefore that deadly glow died from the rocks and life could return again to fill that silent,\nempty world. … \nSo, at last, Marvin understood the purpose of this pilgrimage. He [his father] would\nnever walk beside the rivers of that lost and legendary world, or listen to the thunder raging\nabove its softly rounded hills. Yet one day — how far ahead? — his children’s children\nwould return to claim their heritage. The winds and the rains would scour the poisons from\nthe burning lands and carry them to the sea, and in the depths of the sea they would waste\ntheir venom until they could harm no living things. Then the great ships that were still\nwaiting here on the silent, dusty plains could lift once more into space, along the road that\nled to home. …",

        "passage": "Is text-messaging driving us apart? These days, we talk to each other a lot with our\nthumbs—mashing out over six billion text messages a day in the United States, and likely a\nfew billion more on services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.\nBut some worry that so much messaging leads, paradoxically, to less communication.\nWhen Sherry Turkle, the MIT clinical psychologist and author, interviewed college\nstudents, they said texting was causing friction in their face-to-face interactions. While\nhanging out with friends they’d be texting surreptitiously at the same time, pretending to\nmaintain eye contact but mentally somewhere else. The new form of communication was\nfun, sure, but it was colliding with—and eroding—the old one.\n“Our texts are fine,” as one student said. “It’s what texting does to our conversations\nwhen we are together that’s the problem.” …\nNew technologies often unsettle the way we relate to one another, of course. But social\nruptures caused by texting have a strong echo in the arguments we had a hundred years ago.\nThat’s when a newfangled appliance gave us a strange new way to contact one another en\nmasse: the telephone. …\nAt first, the telephone was marketed mainly as a tool for business. Physicians and\ndrugstores bought them to process orders, and business owners installed them at home so\nthey could be quickly reached. The phone, proclaimed early ad copy, gave business leaders\nan ESP-like “sixth sense” of their far-flung operations. …\nNonetheless, the telephone quickly gave birth to curious new forms of socializing.\nCallers arranged regular weekly “visiting” calls, dialing remote family to catch up on news.\n“Distance rolls away and for a few minutes every Thursday night the familiar voices tell the\nlittle family gossip that both are so eager to hear,” a Bell ad cooed in 1921.\nPhone companies even boasted that the phone was an improvement over that stodgy,\nlow-fi communication, the letter. “Correspondence will help for a time, but friendships do\nnot flourish for long on letters alone,” a 1931 Bell sales manual noted. “When you can’t visit\nin person, telephone periodically. Telephone calls will keep up the whole intimacy\nremarkably well.”\nSoon, though, social critics began to wonder: Was all this phone chatter good for us?\nWas it somehow a lesser form of communication than what had come before? “Does the\ntelephone make men more active or more lazy?” wondered the Knights of Columbus in a\n1926 meeting. “Does the telephone break up home life and the old practice of visiting\nfriends?”\nOthers worried that the inverse would occur—that it would be so easy to talk that we’d\nnever leave each other alone. “Thanks to the telephone, motor-car and such-like inventions,\nour neighbors have it in their power to turn our leisure into a series of interruptions,”\ncomplained an American professor in 1929. And surely it couldn’t be healthy to talk to each\nother so much. Wouldn’t it create Too Much Information [TMI]?\n“We shall soon be nothing but transparent heaps of jelly to each other,” a London writer\nmoaned in 1897. Others fretted that the telephone sped up life, demanding instant\nreactions. “The use of the telephone gives little room for reflection,” wrote a British \nnewspaper in 1899. “It does not improve the temper, and it engenders a feverishness in the\nordinary concerns of life which does not make for domestic happiness and comfort.”\nPerhaps the strangest thing was being in the room while a friend talked to someone\nelse—someone outside the room. In 1880, Mark Twain wrote “A Telephonic Conversation,”\ntranscribing the half-a-conversation as he listened to his wife on the phone. To the observer,\nas the skit pointed out, a telephone call sounded like disjointed nonsense. Even phone\ncompanies worried about whether the device created new forms of rude behavior; a 1910\nBell ad warned about “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde at the Telephone.” …\nIndeed, some believed the phone improved our social behavior, because it forced a\nlistener to pay closer attention to a speaker. Devoid of visual signals, we must be “all ears\nand memory,” a pundit wrote in 1915: “The mind cannot wander.” Plus, by eradicating\ndistance, wouldn’t the phone reduce misunderstanding? War, even? “Someday we will build\nup a world telephone system making necessary to all peoples the use of a common language,\nor common understanding of languages, which will join all the people of the earth into one\nbrotherhood,” gushed John J. Carty, AT&T chief engineer, in 1907.\nThese utopian views, of course, were wildly optimistic. But the gloomy views of\npessimists, as [author, Claude] Fischer notes, didn’t come true either. Even Emily Post, the\netiquette expert, came around to the telephone. By the 1920s, she’d accepted “Hello” as a\nsuitable greeting, and even thought it was acceptable to invite someone to dinner with a\ncall. “Custom which has altered many ways and manners has taken away all opprobrium5\nfrom the message,” she shrugged.\nNowadays, the telephone call seems like a quaint throwback to a gentler era. When\nJenna Birch, the journalist, started dating a man who insisted on calling her on the phone,\nshe found it warm and delightful—though her friends thought the behavior odd. Phone\ncalls now seem retro.\nAcademics have observed this shift, too. “My students just do not think of the phone as\na mechanism of vocal interaction—they think of that as very rare,” says John Durham\nPeters, a communication professor at the University of Iowa, and author of Speaking Into\nthe Air. He doesn’t think the shift to texting has degraded our interactions, though. By the\nmiddle of the 20th century, studies found that the telephone appeared not to have eroded\nsocial contact—indeed, some research found those with phones wrote more old-fashioned\nletters than those without. Similarly, modern surveys by the Pew Research Center have\nfound that teenagers who text the most are also those who spend the most time face to face\nwith friends. Communication, it seems, begets more communication, and—as Peters\nargues—just because talk happens in text doesn’t mean it’s not meaningful.\n“Media scholars,” he notes, “have this long romance with ‘conversation’ as the cure to\nthe disease of media.”\nStill, it’s not hard to be dispirited by the divided attention so many of Turkle’s subjects\nbemoaned in their lives. Indeed, Michéle Martin, of Carleton, thinks we’re living through\na replay of the telephone, where the things that made it valuable—instant\ncommunications—are the same that made it annoying. “People believe they are liberated \nbecause they can bring the mobile phone everywhere,” Martin says. “But at the same time\nthey are slaves to it.”\nThe poet Carl Sandburg captured that dissonance in a 1916 poem about the telephone.\nHe imagined a telephone wire being aware of the disparate uses to which it was being\nput—coursing with conversations both deep and frivolous. “It is love and war and money;\nit is the fighting and the tears, the work and want / Death and laughter of men and women\npassing through me, carrier of your speech.”",

        "passage": "Eilis Lacey, sitting at the window of the upstairs living room in the house on Friary\nStreet, noticed her sister walking briskly from work. She watched Rose crossing the street\nfrom sunlight into shade, carrying the new leather handbag that she had bought in Clerys\nin Dublin [Ireland] in the sale. Rose was wearing a cream-coloured cardigan over her\nshoulders. Her golf clubs were in the hall; in a few minutes, Eilis knew, someone would call\nfor her and her sister would not return until the summer evening had faded.\nEilis’s bookkeeping classes were almost ended now; she had a manual on her lap about\nsystems of accounting, and on the table behind her was a ledger where she had entered, as\nher homework, on the debit and credit sides, the daily business of a company whose details\nshe had taken down in notes in the Vocational School the week before.\nAs soon as she heard the front door open, Eilis went downstairs. Rose, in the hall, was\nholding her pocket mirror in front of her face. She was studying herself closely as she\napplied lipstick and eye make-up before glancing at her overall appearance in the large hall\nmirror, settling her hair. Eilis looked on silently as her sister moistened her lips and then\nchecked herself one more time in the pocket mirror before putting it away.\nTheir mother came from the kitchen to the hall. …\nRose reached into her handbag and took out her purse. She placed a one-shilling piece\non the hallstand. “That’s in case you want to go to the pictures,” she said to Eilis.\n“And what about me?” her mother asked.\n“She’ll tell you the story when she gets home,” Rose replied. …\nAll three laughed as they heard a car stop outside the door and beep its horn. Rose\npicked up her golf clubs and was gone.\nLater, as her mother washed the dishes and Eilis dried them, another knock came to the\ndoor. When Eilis answered it, she found a girl whom she recognized from Kelly’s grocery\nshop beside the cathedral.\n“Miss Kelly sent me with a message for you,” the girl said. “She wants to see you.”\n“Does she?” Eilis asked. “And did she say what it was about?”\n“No. You’re just to call up there tonight.” …\nMiss Kelly slowly came down the stairs into the hallway and turned on a light.\n“Now,” she said, and repeated it as though it were a greeting. She did not smile. …\n“I hear you have no job at all but a great head for figures.”\n“Is that right?”\n“Oh, the whole town, anyone who is anyone, comes into the shop and I hear\neverything.” …\n“And we are worked off our feet every Sunday here. Sure, there’s nothing else open. \nAnd we get all sorts, good, bad and indifferent. And, as a rule, I open after seven mass, and\nbetween the end of nine o’clock mass until eleven mass is well over, there isn’t room to\nmove in this shop. I have Mary here to help, but she’s slow enough at the best of times, so\nI was on the lookout for someone sharp, someone who would know people and give the\nright change. But only on Sundays, mind. The rest of the week we can manage ourselves.\nAnd you were recommended. I made inquiries about you and it would be seven and six a\nweek, it might help your mother a bit.” …\n“Well?” Miss Kelly asked.\nEilis realized that she could not turn down the offer. It would be better than nothing\nand, at the moment, she had nothing. …\nRose, at thirty, Eilis thought, was more glamorous every year, and, while she had had\nseveral boyfriends, she remained single; she often remarked that she had a much better life\nthan many of her former schoolmates who were to be seen pushing prams through the\nstreets. Eilis was proud of her sister, of how much care she took with her appearance and\nhow much care she put into whom she mixed with in the town and the golf club. She knew\nthat Rose had tried to find her work in an office, and Rose was paying for her books now\nthat she was studying bookkeeping and rudimentary accountancy, but she knew also that\nthere was, at least for the moment, no work for anyone in Enniscorthy, no matter what their\nqualifications.\nEilis did not tell Rose about her offer of work from Miss Kelly; instead, as she went\nthrough her training, she saved up every detail to recount to her mother, who laughed and\nmade her tell some parts of the story again.\n“That Miss Kelly,” her mother said, “is as bad as her mother and I heard from someone\nwho worked there that that woman was evil incarnate. And she was just a maid in Roche’s\nbefore she married. And Kelly’s used to be a boarding house as well as a shop, and if you\nworked for her, or even if you stayed there, or dealt in the shop, she was evil incarnate.\nUnless, of course, you had plenty of money or were one of the clergy.”\n“I’m just there until something turns up,” Eilis said.\n“That’s what I said to Rose when I was telling her,” her mother replied. “And don’t listen\nto her if she says anything to you.” …\nOne day at dinnertime Rose, who walked home from the office at one and returned at\na quarter to two, mentioned that she had played golf the previous evening with a priest, a\nFather Flood, who had known their father years before and their mother when she was a\nyoung girl. He was home from America on holidays, his first visit since before the war. …\n“Anyway,” Rose said, “I invited him in for his tea when he said that he’d like to call on\nyou [the mother] and he’s coming tomorrow.” …\nFather Flood was tall; his accent was a mixture of Irish and American. Nothing he said\ncould convince Eilis’s mother that she had known him or his family. His mother, he said,\nhad been a Rochford.\n“I don’t think I knew her,” her mother said. “The only Rochford we knew was old\nHatchethead.” \nFather Flood looked at her solemnly. “Hatchethead was my uncle,” he said.\n“Was he?” her mother asked. Eilis saw how close she was to nervous laughter. …\nRose poured more tea as Eilis quietly left the room, afraid that if she stayed she would\nbe unable to disguise an urge to begin laughing.\nWhen she returned she realized that Father Flood had heard about her job at Miss\nKelly’s, had found out about her pay and had expressed shock at how low it was. He\ninquired about her qualifications.\n“In the United States,” he said, “there would be plenty of work for someone like you\nand with good pay.” …\n“In Brooklyn, where my parish is, there would be office work for someone who was\nhard-working and educated and honest.”\n“It’s very far away, though,” her mother said. “That’s the only thing.” …\n“It would be a great opportunity, especially if you were young,” Father Flood said\nfinally. …\nEilis felt like a child when the doctor would come to the house, her mother listening\nwith cowed respect. It was Rose’s silence that was new to her; she looked at her now,\nwanting her sister to ask a question or make a comment, but Rose appeared to be in a sort\nof dream. As Eilis watched her, it struck her that she had never seen Rose look so beautiful.\nAnd then it occurred to her that she was already feeling that she would need to remember\nthis room, her sister, this scene, as though from a distance. In the silence that had lingered,\nshe realized, it had somehow been tacitly arranged that Eilis would go to America. Father\nFlood, she believed, had been invited to the house because Rose knew that he could\narrange it. …",

        "passage": "“What is the difference between yesterday and tomorrow?” The Yupno man we were\ninterviewing, Danda, paused to consider his answer. A group of us sat on a hillside in the\nYupno Valley, a remote nook high in the mountains of Papua New Guinea. Only days\nearlier we had arrived on a single-engine plane. After a steep hike from the grass airstrip,\nwe found ourselves in the village of Gua, one of about 20 Yupno villages dotting the rugged\nterrain. We came all the way here because we are interested in time—in how Yupno people\nunderstand concepts such as past, present and future. Are these ideas universal, or are they\nproducts of our language, our culture and our environment?\nAs we interviewed Danda and others in the village, we listened to what they said about\ntime, but we paid even closer attention to what they did with their hands as they spoke.\nGestures can be revealing. Ask English speakers about the difference between yesterday\nand tomorrow, and they might thrust a hand over the shoulder when referring to the past\nand then forward when referring to the future. Such unreflective movements reveal a\nfundamental way of thinking in which the past is at our backs, something that we “leave\nbehind,” and the future is in front of us, something to “look forward” to. Would a Yupno\nspeaker do the same?\nDanda was making just the kinds of gestures we were hoping for. As he explained the\nYupno word for “yesterday,” his hand swept backward; as he mentioned “tomorrow,” it\nleaped forward. We all sat looking up a steep slope toward a jagged ridge, but as the light\nfaded, we changed the camera angle, spinning around so that we and Danda faced in the\nopposite direction, downhill. With our backs now to the ridge, we looked over the Yupno\nRiver meandering toward the Bismarck Sea. “Let’s go over that one more time,” we\nsuggested.\nDanda obliged, again using his hands to enliven his explanation. But as we expected, his\ngestures had changed. As he referred to “yesterday,” he now gestured, not backward, but\nforward. As he explained “tomorrow,” he gestured back over his shoulder, up toward the\nridge. Inconsistent as these movements may seem, Danda was not confused. His gestures\nexpressed the Yupno way of understanding time, one in which the future is not something\nin front of you—it is uphill. By having interviewees change sitting positions, we were able\nto show that it does not matter whether the slope is in front of you, behind you, to your left\nor to your right. The Yupno conception of time is not anchored to the body, as the Western\none is, but to the world and its contours. By investigating cases such as these, we and other\nresearchers are starting to piece together an answer to a question that has puzzled thinkers\nfor centuries: How are human beings able to make sense of time?\nHumans, like creatures ranging from amoebas and bees to mockingbirds and elephants,\ncome with built-in equipment for perceiving some aspects of time, such as the rhythms of\nnight and day, the waxing and waning of the moon, and the turning of the seasons. What\nseparates humans from other animals is that we do not stop at merely sensing time’s\npassage. We tackle time head-on—or at least we try. We dice it into units, even ones that go\nbeyond what is perceivable, such as milliseconds, or that transcend our life span, such as\nmillennia. We depict time graphically, talk about it ceaselessly and even make gestural\nmodels of it in the air as we talk. In short, humans everywhere create and rely on time\nconcepts—ideas about the nature of time that allow us to make plans, follow recipes, share\nmemories and discuss possible futures.\nBut what are our time concepts made of? What is going on in the mind of a speaker of\nYupno, or English for that matter, when answering our question about the difference\nbetween yesterday and tomorrow? Recent research in cognitive science is uncovering a\nsurprising answer. Across cultures, human time concepts depend, in large part, on\nmetaphor—in particular, on what cognitive scientists call conceptual metaphor, in which we\nthink about something, in this case time, in terms of something else, in this case space.\nThus, we build our understanding of duration, of time’s passage and of sequences of events\nout of familiar spatial ideas such as size, movement and location. The latest findings reveal\nthat this basic “time is like space” metaphor appears to be universal around the world—yet\nit also takes strikingly different forms from one culture to the next. …\nWe sometimes imagine ourselves inside the sequence of events, with past, present and\nfuture conceptualized as locations where we once were, currently are and will be. This\ninternal perspective on time motivates English expressions such as “the week ahead of us.”\nWhen we take the external perspective, however, we view the succession of events from the\noutside, much like watching a lineup of people all moving in one direction. This external\nperspective motivates phrases such as “a reception follows the ceremony.”\nThese basic ideas about time are expressed spatially in a dazzling variety of unrelated\nlanguages, across cultures that differ in every way imaginable. The idea that temporal5\nsequences are like queues of people is found, for example, in Tamil (India), Maori (New\nZealand), Greenlandic (Greenland) and Sesotho (South Africa), where the idea that “spring\nfollows winter” can be expressed as “spring is in the footprints left by winter.”\nBut now we come to a wrinkle. Even as people of all cultures lean on spatial concepts\nfor understanding time, exactly which spatial metaphors they use can vary. Take the internal\nperspective, future-in-front metaphor mentioned earlier, found in English and many other\nlanguages. This metaphor was long thought to be universal, but in 2006 members of our\nteam investigated a striking counterexample in South America. In Aymara, a language\nspoken high in the Andes, many phrases suggest the opposite metaphor is at work. For\nexample, the expression “a long time ago” could be loosely rendered in Aymara as “a lot of\ntime in front.” Analysis of video-recorded interviews with 30 speakers showed conclusively\nthat Aymara speakers gesture according to this future-behind, past-in-front metaphor. The\npattern is especially strong among older speakers who do not speak Spanish, which has the\nfuture-in-front metaphor common to English and most European languages. …\nThe human reliance on spatial metaphors for abstract thinking may have deep\nevolutionary roots and is not likely to change any time soon. The particular metaphors we\nlean on, however, are a product of culture—not of biological evolution—and are much\nmore malleable. Literacy is a recent and rapid achievement in the scope of the human saga,\nbut it already has had profound consequences for how people conceptualize time. New \nspatial metaphors for our dearest abstract concepts will almost certainly enter the picture\nas our culture evolves. E-mail in-boxes show the most recent items at the top, but text\nmessages go the other way, with the newest at the bottom. And so we must wonder: Which\nway will time flow next?",

This had seemed all well and fine when the plans were made long-\ndistance with Uncle Baby shouting into the receiver that he insisted, that he and Ninfa\nwouldn’t think of her staying anywhere else, that the girls were thrilled she was coming. But\nnow that she was actually sleeping in [granddaughter] Amor’s narrow bed with radios and\ntelevisions chattering throughout the apartment, and doors and cupboards banging, and the\nstink of cigarettes soaking into everything, even her skin, and trucks rumbling past and\nshaking the building like an earthquake, and sirens and car horns at all hours, well, it just\nabout drove her crazy; even the rowdy Chicago wind, a rough, moody brute who took one\nlook at you and laughed. …\nAll day and all night the expressway traffic whooshed past, keeping the Grandmother\nawake. She napped when she could, even when the apartment and its inhabitants jabbered\nthe loudest. She was tired all the time, and yet she had trouble sleeping, often waking once\nor twice in the early morning, and in her sleeplessness, padding in her house slippers to the\nliving room, where the front windows looked out onto the lanes of traffic, the expressway\nbillboards, and the frighteningly grimy factories beyond. The trucks and cars, furious to get\nfrom here to there, never paused for a moment, the sound of the expressway almost not a\nsound at all, but a roar like the voice of the sea trapped inside a shell.\nShe pressed her forehead against the cold glass and sighed. If the Grandmother had\nconsulted her feelings, she would’ve understood why it was taking her so long to buy a new\nhouse and settle in Chicago, but she was not a woman given to reflection. She missed her\nold house too much and was too proud to admit she’d made a mistake. She couldn’t go\nbackward, could she? She was stuck, in the middle of nowhere it seemed, halfway between\nhere and where?\nThe Grandmother missed the routine of her mornings, her three-minute eggs and\nbolillo breakfasts. She missed rubbing her big toe along the octagon tiles of her bathroom\nfloor. But most of all, she missed her own bed with its mattress sagging in the center, the\nfamiliar scent and weight of her blankets, the way morning entered gradually from the left \nas the sun climbed over the east courtyard wall, the one topped with a cockscomb of glass\nshards to keep out the thieves. Why do we get so used to waking up in a certain room? And\nwhen we aren’t in our own bed and wake up in another, a terrible fear for a moment, like\ndeath.\nThere is nothing worse than being a houseguest for too long, especially when your host\nis a relative. The Grandmother felt like a prisoner. She hated climbing up the three flights\nof stairs, and always arrived clutching her heart, convinced she was having an attack, like\nthe one that killed Narciso [her husband]. Really, once she was upstairs, she couldn’t even\nbear the thought of coming back down. What a barbarity! …\nTo visit Chicago is one thing, to live there another. This was not the Chicago of her\nvacations, where one is always escorted to the lake shore, to the gold coast, driven along the\nwinding lanes of traffic of Lake Shore Drive in the shadow of beautiful apartment buildings,\nalong State Street and Michigan Avenue to window-shop at least. And perhaps taken on an\nexcursion on the lake. How is it she hadn’t noticed the expression of the citizens, not the\nones fluttering in and out of taxis, but the ones at bus stops, hopping like sparrows, shivering\nand peering anxiously for the next bus, and those descending wearily into the filthy bowels\nof the subway like the souls condemned to purgatory.\nAt first the Grandmother was thrilled by the restaurants and the big discount chains—\nbut then the routine got to be too familiar. Saturdays in search of houses that were not to\nher liking. Dark brick houses with small, squinty windows, gloomy apartments, or damp\nlittle bungalows, everything somber and sad and not letting in enough light, and no\ncourtyards, a dank, mean gangway, a small patch of thin grass called a garden, and maybe a\nbald tree in front. This wasn’t what she had in mind.\nAnd as the weeks and months passed, and she was still without a house, the rainy, cold\nautumn weather began and only made her feel worse. There was the Chicago winter\ncoming that everyone had warned her about, and she was already so cold and miserable she\ndidn’t feel much like leaving her room, let alone the building. She blamed Ninfa, who kept\nlowering the heat in order to save money. The Grandmother confined herself to bed,\nsatisfied only when she was under several layers of blankets. …\nBut nothing, nothing in the Grandmother’s imagination prepared her for the horrors of\na Chicago winter. It was not the picturesque season of Christmas, but the endless tundra\nof January, February, and March. Daylight dimmed to a dull pewter. The sun a thick piece\nof ice behind a dirty woolen sky. It was a cold like you can’t imagine, a barbarous thing, a\nknife in the bone, a cold so cold it burned the lungs if one could even believe such a cold.\nAnd the mountains of filthy snow shoveled in huge heaps, the chunks of ice on the sidewalk\nthat could kill an aged citizen. —Oh, this is nothing, you should’ve been here for the Big\nSnow, the grandchildren bragged, speaking of the recent storm of ’68.\nBig snow or little snow, it was all the same after the novelty of snow had worn off. A\nnuisance, a deadly thing, an exaggerated, long, drawn-out ordeal that made one feel like\ndying, that killed one slowly, a torture. Let me die in February, let me die rather than have\nto step out the door again, please, the Grandmother thought to herself, dreading having to\ndress like a monster to go outside. —Ay, ya no puedo. I can’t anymore, I can’t. And just\nwhen she could no longer, when she could no longer find the strength, the drive, the will to \nkeep on living, when she was ready to fold into herself and let her spirit die, just then, and\nonly then, did April arrive with sky the color of hope and branches filled with possibilities.",

        "passage": "The nightmare began when my husband walked into our kitchen and said, “I’ve had this\nsong stuck in my head all day …”\nNo! I thought. Don’t say it!\n“Remember that song from the original Karate Kid movie?” he continued.\nFor the love of God, no!\n“You know how it goes. ‘You’re the best around … na na na na na, na na na na. You’re\nthe best around …”\nIt was too late. Now I had an earworm — a song, melody or jingle that gets stuck in your\nhead.\nThe worst part? I only knew that same line. I walked around humming it for days. I tried\nto shake it by singing along with tunes playing on my car radio while I was out running\nerrands. For a brief time, Van Halen’s “Runnin’ With the Devil” replaced it.\nBut in no time at all, that one line from “You’re the Best,” sung by Joe Esposito on the\nThe Karate Kid soundtrack, was back.\nPerhaps if I heard more of the song in my head, it wouldn’t be as annoying. But just this\none line? Over and over and over again? It was pure torture. I needed to do something\ndrastic. I busted out that 1980s hit, “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats. After singing\nit a few times, the earworm was gone.\nI knew I’d get another one, though. About 90 percent of people experience earworms\nat least once a week, according to the Earworm Project run by the Music, Mind and Brain\ngroup at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n“Music lovers, specifically people who ascribe more importance to music or people\nwho spend more time listening to music, have more frequent and longer earworm\nepisodes,” says Kelly Jakubowski, a researcher with the Earworm Project. …\nTo find out what causes earworms and how to get rid of them, I contacted the man\nknown as “Dr. Earworm,” James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of\nCincinnati. Certainly with a nickname like that, he would know something.\nKellaris began studying earworms in 1999. A former professional musician prone to\ngetting earworms himself, he eventually became a marketing professor “interested in how\nmarketers use music to achieve various commercial goals,” he says. “It was a perfect storm\nto create an earworms researcher.”\nHe explained to me that when we get an earworm, the tune seems to repeat itself\ninvoluntarily, which is why experts consider earworms involuntary musical imagery (INMI).\nThis was exactly what “You’re the Best” had done to me.\nSo what, precisely, was happening in my brain when I couldn’t shake that tune?\nJakubowski contributed to a May 2015 study led by Nicolas Farrugia, a postdoctoral\nresearcher with the Earworm Project, that demonstrated auditory and inhibitory-related\nareas play a role in earworms as well.\nThe researchers examined 44 healthy subjects, all between 25 and 70 years old and all\nparticipants of a past neuroimaging study run by the Cambridge Medical Research \nCouncil’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. These subjects took an online survey that\nmeasured both the extent of their musical training and how strongly INMIs impacted them.\nFor example, the survey wanted to know how strong of a negative impact INMIs had on\nthem or if INMIs were actually helpful while they went about their everyday activities.\nWhen they examined these participants’ brain images, one pattern in particular stuck\nout: People who got earworms more often had a thinner right frontal cortex, which is\ninvolved in inhibition, and a thinner temporal cortex, which processes sensory stimuli like\nsound. In other words, these people’s brains just weren’t as good at suppressing the random\nsong that might pop into their heads.\nWhy we get earworms, unfortunately, remains a scientific mystery. “We know that songs\nthat are ‘catchy’ — short, simple, repetitive and contain some incongruity — are most likely\nto get stuck,” Kellaris says. Most people are more likely to get a song like “Don’t Worry, Be\nHappy” stuck in their heads than, say, a Mahler symphony. And some things exacerbate\nthem: frequency and duration of exposure to music, worry, stress, fatigue and idleness.\nConsidering that my husband kept singing the snippet while I was tired and stressed,\nI can see why it got stuck. But my earworms have been relatively innocuous. Even though\nthey’re annoying, I can eventually get rid of them. Some people can’t, though.\nPart of Kellaris’ earliest research involved mailing a questionnaire to about 1,000\nrespondents at four U.S. universities. He asked them if they’d ever had an earworm, for how\nlong, how often it happened, how it made them feel, etc.\nOne respondent claimed to have had a song stuck in his head since 1978. This is known\nas intrusive musical imagery (IMI), a musical obsession that’s chronic and highly distracting\nto a person’s everyday life and work. According to Dean McKay, a psychology professor at\nFordham University, my short-lived earworm was nothing compared to an IMI.\nBut now I was concerned. Could my future earworms turn into these IMIs? Is there a\nway to prevent this from happening?\nMcKay co-authored a June 2014 study titled “Musical obsessions: A comprehensive\nreview of neglected clinical phenomena.” For this study, McKay and other international\ncolleagues, all of whom treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, created the first\ncomprehensive review of musical obsessions. They compiled a database of 96 case study\ndescriptions of people with severe musical obsessions — the largest compilation assembled\non this topic. They determined the characteristics of musical obsessions such as IMIs and\ncompared them with earworms, musical hallucinations and visual obsessional imagery.\nThe group’s research showed that IMIs can be treated by using a method known as\ndistraction — coming up with a competing melody to think about that would get rid of the\nIMI. That’s exactly what I had done, albeit unknowingly, when I used “The Safety Dance”\nto stop my earworm.\nMcKay says my earworm was pesky because I knew only that one part of the song. He\nsuggests if I have just a portion of a song looping in my brain in the future, I can try another\nmethod called exposure — simply listening to the entire song. “It’s like a completion task,”\nhe says. “Once you know the whole song, then there’s no need for it to be stuck in your\nhead.” \nAnother form of distraction is to sing the song out loud, but change some of the words\nor slightly throw off the melody. One of McKay’s patients had an IMI based on a Taylor\nSwift song. “We made up some other words for it,” he explains. “We messed up the melody\na bit, but not so much that it wasn’t recognizable as still being that song, and then it faded.”\nMcKay stresses that this is the only case he’s tried this in, so it’s not a forgone conclusion\nthis kind of distraction would work in other instances.\nWhat I wanted to know was if the earworm I get today could become the IMI of\ntomorrow.\n“Highly improbable,” he says.\n“You’re the best,” I reply.\nOh no.",

        "passage": "I never see asters without remembering her—never the haze of their pink and lavender\nblossoming as summer dies, but her name is in my heart: Reverdy, Reverdy.\nI never say her name—not to anyone. When people ask about her, as they do\noccasionally even now, I say “she” and “her.” “She is still gone.” “We do not hear from her.”\n“Yes, she was very beautiful,” I say. But not her name. …\nI have longed all these years to tell her how it was the night she left. You may scarcely\nbelieve it, but it is worse to have a good thing that is not true believed about you, than a\nbad. To be thanked for an act you meant as harmful—every year those words sharpen until\nat last they cut like knives.\nYou mustn’t think she was like me. She wasn’t in the least. Not inside nor out. She had\ndark hair like a cloud. Yes, really. It wasn’t curly but it didn’t hang straight. It billowed out.\nAnd her face—oh, you mustn’t think it was anything like mine. She had hazel eyes and a\npointed chin. And you’ve seen lots of people, haven’t you, with very live, animated faces and\ndead eyes? It was just the other way with Reverdy. Her face was always quiet, but her eyes\nwere so alive they glowed. Oh, she was the most beautiful, most alive, and most loving girl\nin the world, and she was my sister.\nI cannot bear for people to say we were alike—she was really good, and I was just a\nshow-off. …\nOne evening in October, when it was almost dark, I was coming home from the library,\ncoasting across lots in the hot dry Santa Ana that had been blowing all day. Cool weather\nhad already come, and then three days of this hot wind. Dust everywhere. Under your\neyelids, between your fingers, in your mouth. When we went to school in the morning the\nfirst thing we’d do would be to write our names in the dust on our desks. I had on a skirt\nfull of pleats that evening, and I pulled the pleats out wide so the skirt made a sort of sail\nand the wind almost pushed me along. I watched the tumble weeds blowing, and listened\nto the wind in the clump of eucalyptus by the barn, and felt miserable and gritty. Then\nI saw Reverdy walking up and down the driveway by the house and I felt suddenly glad.\nReverdy loved the wind, even Santa Ana’s, and she was always out walking or running when\nthe wind blew, if she didn’t have any work to do. She liked to carry a scarf in her hand and\nhold it up in the wind so she could feel it tug and snap. When I saw Reverdy I forgot how\ndusty and hot the wind was and remembered only how alive it was and how Reverdy loved\nit. I ran toward her but she didn’t wave or say a word, and when she reached the end of the\ndriveway she turned her back on me and started walking toward the barn.\nBefore I had a chance to say a word to her, Mother came to the door and called to me\nto come in and not talk to Reverdy. As soon as I heard her voice before I could see her face,\nI knew there was some trouble—some trouble with Reverdy—and I knew what kind of\ntrouble, too. I went in the house and shut the door. The sound of Reverdy’s footsteps on the\npepper leaves in the driveway outside stopped and Mother put her head out of the window\nand said, “You’re to keep walking, Reverdy, and not stop. Understand? I want to hear\nfootsteps and I want them to be brisk.” Then she closed the window, though it was hard to\ndo against the wind.\nI stood with my face to the window and looked out into the dusty, windy dark where I\ncould just see Reverdy in her white dress walking up and down, never stopping, her head\nbent, not paying any attention to the wind she loved. It made me feel sick to see her walking\nup and down there in the dusty dark like a homeless dog, while we were snug inside.\nBut Mother came over to the window and took the curtain out of my hand and put it\nback over the glass. Then she put her arm around my shoulders and pressed me close to her\nand said, “Mother’s own dear girl who has never given her a moment’s trouble.”\nThat wasn’t true. Mother had plenty of fault to find with me usually … but it was sweet\nto have her speak lovingly to me, to be cherished and appreciated. Maybe you can’t\nunderstand that, maybe your family was always loving, maybe you were always dear little\ndaughter, or maybe, a big golden wonder-boy. But not me and not my mother. So try to\nunderstand how it was with me, then, and how happy it made me to have Mother put her\narms about me. Yes, I thought, I’m Mother’s comfort. And I forgot I couldn’t make a boy\nlook at me if I wanted to and blamed Reverdy for not being able to steer clear of them the\nway I did. She just hasn’t any consideration for any of us, I decided. Oh, I battened on\nReverdy’s downfall all right. …\n[Our ten-year-old brother] Chummie came back from feeding his rabbits and sat with\nme in the dark room. Then I got the idea of a way to show Mother how much I was her\ncomfort and mainstay, her darling younger daughter, dutiful and harmonious as hell.\nMother wanted me and Chummie to be musical—she’d given up with Reverdy—but\nChummie and I had taken lessons for years. Usually we kicked and howled at having to play,\nso, I thought, if we play now it will show Mother how thoughtful and reliable we are. It will\ncheer her up while she’s out there in the wind talking to that bad Reverdy. Yes, she will\nthink, I have one fine, dependable daughter, anyway. …\nI was asleep when Reverdy did come in. She sat down on the side of my bed, and it was\njust her sitting there that finally awakened me. Then, when I was awake she picked up my\nhand and began to press my finger-tips one by one, and spoke in the sweetest, kindest voice.\nYou’d never have thought to hear her that she had just spent four or five hours the way she\ndid.\nShe said, “I’ll never forget your playing for me, Sister. Never. Never. It was kind and\nbeautiful of you. Just when I thought I was all alone I heard you telling me not to be sad.”\nThen she leaned over and kissed me and said, “Good night, now. I’ve put some asters in\nwater for you. They’re a little wilted but I think they’ll be all right by morning. Go to sleep,\nnow. I’ll never forget, Clare.”\nIf I could only have told her,—if I could only have told her then. If I could have said to\nher, “I was playing for Mother, Reverdy. I guess I was jealous of your always having the\nlimelight. I wanted to be first for once.” If I could only have said, “I love you more than\nanything, Reverdy, but I have a mean soul,” she would have put her cheek to mine and said,\n“Oh, Clare, what a thing to say.”\nBut I couldn’t do it and next morning she was gone. And there on the table by my bed\nwere the asters she had left for me, grown fresh over night.",

        "passage": "…Dislike of noise has produced some of history’s most eager advocates of silence, as\n[Hillel] Schwartz explains in his book Making Noise: From Babel to the Big Bang and\nBeyond. In 1859, the British nurse and social reformer Florence Nightingale wrote,\n“Unnecessary noise is the most cruel absence of care that can be inflicted on sick or well.”\nEvery careless clatter or banal bit of banter, Nightingale argued, can be a source of alarm,\ndistress, and loss of sleep for recovering patients. She even quoted a lecture that identified\n“sudden noises” as a cause of death among sick children.\nSurprisingly, recent research supports some of Nightingale’s zealous claims. In the mid\n20th century, epidemiologists discovered correlations between high blood pressure and\nchronic noise sources like highways and airports. Later research seemed to link noise to\nincreased rates of sleep loss, heart disease, and tinnitus. (It’s this line of research that\nhatched the 1960s-era notion of “noise pollution,” a name that implicitly refashions\ntransitory noises as toxic and long-lasting.)\nStudies of human physiology help explain how an invisible phenomenon can have such\na pronounced physical effect. Sound waves vibrate the bones of the ear, which transmit\nmovement to the snail-shaped cochlea. The cochlea converts physical vibrations into\nelectrical signals that the brain receives. The body reacts immediately and powerfully to\nthese signals, even in the middle of deep sleep. Neurophysiological research suggests that\nnoises first activate the amygdalae, clusters of neurons located in the temporal lobes of the\nbrain, associated with memory formation and emotion. The activation prompts an\nimmediate release of stress hormones like cortisol. People who live in consistently loud\nenvironments often experience chronically elevated levels of stress hormones.\nJust as the whooshing of a hundred individual cars accumulates into an irritating wall of\nbackground noise, the physical effects of noise add up. In 2011, the World Health\nOrganization tried to quantify its health burden in Europe. It concluded that the 340\nmillion residents of western Europe—roughly the same population as that of the United\nStates—annually lost a million years of healthy life because of noise. It even argued that\n3,000 heart disease deaths were, at their root, the result of excessive noise. …\nSilence first began to appear in scientific research as a control or baseline, against which\nscientists compare the effects of noise or music. Researchers have mainly studied it by\naccident, as physician Luciano Bernardi did in a 2006 study of the physiological effects of\nmusic. “We didn’t think about the effect of silence,” he says. “That was not meant to be\nstudied specifically.”\nHe was in for a quiet surprise. Bernardi observed physiological metrics for two dozen\ntest subjects while they listened to six musical tracks. He found that the impacts of music\ncould be read directly in the bloodstream, via changes in blood pressure, carbon dioxide,\nand circulation in the brain. (Bernardi and his son are both amateur musicians, and they\nwanted to explore a shared interest.) “During almost all sorts of music, there was a \nphysiological change compatible with a condition of arousal,” he explains.\nThis effect made sense, given that active listening requires alertness and attention. But\nthe more striking finding appeared between musical tracks. Bernardi and his colleagues\ndiscovered that randomly inserted stretches of silence also had a drastic effect, but in the\nopposite direction. In fact, two-minute silent pauses proved far more relaxing than either\n“relaxing” music or a longer silence played before the experiment started.\nThe blank pauses that Bernardi considered irrelevant, in other words, became the most\ninteresting object of study. Silence seemed to be heightened by contrasts, maybe because it\ngave test subjects a release from careful attention. “Perhaps the arousal is something that\nconcentrates the mind in one direction, so that when there is nothing more arousing, then\nyou have deeper relaxation,” he says.\nIn 2006, Bernardi’s paper on the physiological effects of silence was the mostdownloaded research in the journal Heart. One of his key findings—that silence is\nheightened by contrasts—is reinforced by neurological research. In 2010, Michael Wehr,\nwho studies sensory processing in the brain at the University of Oregon, observed the brains\nof mice during short bursts of sound. The onset of a sound prompts a specialized network\nof neurons in the auditory cortex to light up. But when sounds continue in a relatively\nconstant manner, the neurons largely stop reacting. “What the neurons really do is signal\nwhenever there’s a change,” Wehr says.\nThe sudden onset of silence is a type of change too, and this fact led Wehr to a surprise.\nBefore his 2010 study, scientists knew that the brain reacts to the start of silences. (This\nability helps us react to dangers, for example, or distinguish words in a sentence.) But\nWehr’s research extended those findings by showing that, remarkably, the auditory cortex\nhas a separate network of neurons that fire when silence begins. “When a sound suddenly\nstops, that’s an event just as surely as when a sound starts.”\nEven though we usually think of silences as a lack of input, our brains are structured to\nrecognize them, whenever they represent a sharp break from sounds. So the question is\nwhat happens after that moment—when silence continues, and the auditory cortex settles\ninto a state of relative inactivity.\nOne of the researchers who’s examined this question is a Duke University regenerative\nbiologist, Imke Kirste. Like Bernardi, Kirste wasn’t trying to study silence at all. In 2013,\nshe was examining the effects of sounds in the brains of adult mice. Her experiment\nexposed four groups of mice to various auditory stimuli: music, baby mouse calls, white\nnoise, and silence. She expected that baby mouse calls, as a form of communication, might\nprompt the development of new brain cells. Like Bernardi, she thought of silence as a\ncontrol that wouldn’t produce an effect.\nAs it turned out, even though all the sounds had short-term neurological effects, not one\nof them had a lasting impact. Yet to her great surprise, Kirste found that two hours of\nsilence per day prompted cell development in the hippocampus, the brain region related to\nthe formation of memory, involving the senses. This was deeply puzzling: The total absence\nof input was having a more pronounced effect than any sort of input tested.\nHere’s how Kirste made sense of the results. She knew that “environmental\nenrichment,” like the introduction of toys or fellow mice, encouraged the development of\nneurons because they challenged the brains of mice. Perhaps the total absence of sound\nmay have been so artificial, she reasoned—so alarming, even—that it prompted a higher\nlevel of sensitivity or alertness in the mice. Neurogenesis could be an adaptive response to\nuncanny quiet. … \nWhile it’s clear that external silence can have tangible benefits, scientists are discovering\nthat under the hoods of our skulls “there isn’t really such a thing as silence,” says Robert\nZatorre, an expert on the neurology of sound. “In the absence of sound, the brain often\ntends to produce internal representations of sound.”\nImagine, for example, you’re listening to Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Sound of\nSilence,” when the radio abruptly cuts out. Neurologists have found that if you know the\nsong well, your brain’s auditory cortex remains active, as if the music is still playing. “What\nyou’re ‘hearing’ is not being generated by the outside world,” says David Kraemer, who’s\nconducted these types of experiments in his Dartmouth College laboratory. “You’re\nretrieving a memory.” Sounds aren’t always responsible for sensations—sometimes our\nsubjective sensations are responsible for the illusion of sound.\nThis is a reminder of the brain’s imaginative power: On the blank sensory slate of\nsilence, the mind can conduct its own symphonies. But it’s also a reminder that even in the\nabsence of a sensory input like sound, the brain remains active and dynamic. …",
