{{It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat
earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The
landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor
my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance1 of mankind I rang the bell and gave
a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted
to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of
the articles had a pencil-mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through
it. …
“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the possibility of an
Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great
chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other
arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and
patient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible
perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which
present the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary
problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history
of the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile2 as such an exercise
may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what
to look for. By a man’s fingernails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser-knees, by
the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt-cuffs—by each of
these things a man’s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the
competent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”
“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table; “I never
read such rubbish in my life.”
“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.
“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg-spoon as I sat down to my
breakfast. “I see that you have read it, since you have marked it. I don’t deny that it is smartly
written. It irritates me, though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who
evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical.
I should like to see him clapped down in a third-class carriage on the Underground and
asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against
him.”
“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked, calmly. “As for the article,
I wrote it myself.”
“You?”
“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have
expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical, are really extremely
practical—so practical that I depend upon them for my bread-and-cheese.”
“And how?” I asked, involuntarily.
“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I’m a
consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of
government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come
to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me,
and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them
straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details
of a thousand at your finger-ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first.
Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case,
and that was what brought him here.”
“And these other people?”
“They are mostly sent out by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in
trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to
my comments, and then I pocket my fee.”
“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you can unravel
some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for
themselves?”
“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a
little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see,
I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters
wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn
are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared
to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”
“You were told, no doubt.”
“Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of
thought ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion without being
conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning
ran: ‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an
army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the
natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as
his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and
unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much
hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did
not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were
astonished.” …
I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the
topic.
“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly dressed
individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the
numbers. He had a large, blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a
message.
“You mean the retired sergeant of marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.
“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify his guess.”
The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching
caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a
loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.
“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the
letter.
Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when
he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I said, blandly, “what your trade may be?”
“Commissionnaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”
“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.
“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.”
He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.}}

{{Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge. Its goal is to find
out how the world works, to seek what regularities there may be, to penetrate to the
connections of things—from subnuclear particles, which may be the constituents of all
matter, to living organisms, the human social community, and thence to the cosmos as a
whole. Our intuition is by no means an infallible guide. Our perceptions may be distorted
by training and prejudice or merely because of the limitations of our sense organs, which,
of course, perceive directly but a small fraction of the phenomena of the world. Even so
straightforward a question as whether in the absence of friction a pound of lead falls faster
than a gram of fluff was answered incorrectly by Aristotle and almost everyone else before
the time of Galileo. Science is based on experiment, on a willingness to challenge old
dogma, on an openness to see the universe as it really is. Accordingly, science sometimes
requires courage—at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom.
Beyond this the main trick of science is to really think of something: the shape of clouds
and their occasional sharp bottom edges at the same altitude everywhere in the sky; the
formation of a dewdrop on a leaf; the origin of a name or a word—Shakespeare, say, or
“philanthropic”; the reason for human social customs—the incest taboo, for example; how
it is that a lens in sunlight can make paper burn; how a “walking stick” got to look so much
like a twig; why the Moon seems to follow us as we walk; what prevents us from digging a
hole down to the center of the Earth; what the definition is of “down” on a spherical Earth;
how it is possible for the body to convert yesterday’s lunch into today’s muscle and sinew;
or how far is up—does the universe go on forever, or if it does not, is there any meaning to
the question of what lies on the other side? Some of these questions are pretty easy. Others,
especially the last, are mysteries to which no one even today knows the answer. They are
natural questions to ask. Every culture has posed such questions in one way or another.
Almost always the proposed answers are in the nature of “Just So Stories,” attempted
explanations divorced from experiment, or even from careful comparative observations.
But the scientific cast of mind examines the world critically as if many alternative worlds
might exist, as if other things might be here which are not. Then we are forced to ask why
what we see is present and not something else. Why are the Sun and the Moon and the
planets spheres? Why not pyramids, or cubes, or dodecahedra? Why not irregular, jumbly
shapes? Why so symmetrical, worlds? If you spend any time spinning hypotheses, checking
to see whether they make sense, whether they conform to what else we know, thinking of
tests you can pose to substantiate or deflate your hypotheses, you will find yourself doing
science. And as you come to practice this habit of thought more and more you will get
better and better at it. To penetrate into the heart of the thing—even a little thing, a blade
of grass, as Walt Whitman said—is to experience a kind of exhilaration that, it may be, only
human beings of all the beings on this planet can feel. We are an intelligent species and the
use of our intelligence quite properly gives us pleasure. In this respect the brain is like a
muscle. When we think well, we feel good. Understanding is a kind of ecstasy. …
Let us approach a much more modest question: not whether we can know the universe
or the Milky Way Galaxy or a star or a world. Can we know, ultimately and in detail, a grain
of salt? Consider one microgram of table salt, a speck just barely large enough for someone
with keen eyesight to make out without a microscope. In that grain of salt there are about
1016 sodium and chlorine atoms. This is a 1 followed by 16 zeros, 10 million billion atoms.
If we wish to know a grain of salt, we must know at least the three-dimensional positions of
each of these atoms. (In fact, there is much more to be known—for example, the nature of
the forces between the atoms—but we are making only a modest calculation.) Now, is this
number more or less than the number of things which the brain can know?
How much can the brain know? There are perhaps 1011 neurons in the brain, the
circuit elements and switches that are responsible in their electrical and chemical activity
for the functioning of our minds. A typical brain neuron has perhaps a thousand little wires,
called dendrites, which connect it with its fellows. If, as seems likely, every bit of information
in the brain corresponds to one of these connections, the total number of things knowable
by the brain is no more than 1014, one hundred trillion. But this number is only one
percent of the number of atoms in our speck of salt.
So in this sense the universe is intractable,1 astonishingly immune to any human
attempt at full knowledge. We cannot on this level understand a grain of salt, much less the
universe.
But let us look a little more deeply at our microgram of salt. Salt happens to be a
crystal in which, except for defects in the structure of the crystal lattice, the position of
every sodium and chlorine atom is predetermined. If we could shrink ourselves into this
crystalline world, we would see rank upon rank of atoms in an ordered array, a regularly
alternating structure—sodium, chlorine, sodium, chlorine specifying the sheet of atoms we
are standing on and all the sheets above us and below us. An absolutely pure crystal of salt
could have the position of every atom specified by something like 10 bits of information.2
This would not strain the information-carrying capacity of the brain.
If the universe had natural laws that governed its behavior to the same degree of
regularity that determines a crystal of salt, then, of course, the universe would be knowable.
Even if there were many such laws, each of considerable complexity, human beings might
have the capability to understand them all. Even if such knowledge exceeded the information-
carrying capacity of the brain, we might store the additional information outside our
bodies—in books, for example, or in computer memories—and still, in some sense, know
the universe. …

Against the clamor of the city, who could hear the prayers being uttered in Peace Lane?
Who would notice people whose dearest wish in life is not to be praised for merit but only
to avoid making mistakes? Here a lean-to shed has been added on to the terrace and the
courtyard roofed over to make a kitchen. If you were to look down upon the rooftops of the
city, you would find them in utter disarray, worn and dilapidated, structures built on top of
structures, taking up every bit of free space. This was especially true of the older longtang,
1
like Peace Lane—it’s a miracle that they haven’t collapsed yet. About a third of the tiles
were broken, patched over in places with bits of felt, the wooden frames on the doors and
windows were blackened and rotting, with everything in view a uniform ash gray.
But though it was falling apart on the outside, the spirit of the place remained; its inner
voice, though stifled, was still audible. But amid all the noises of this city, just what did this
voice amount to? There was never a moment of peace and quiet in the city; the day had its
sounds, as did the night, and between them they drowned that voice out. But it was still
there—it couldn’t be silenced because it was the foundation upon which the hubbub and
commotion fed; without it all of those noises would have been nothing but an empty echo.
But what did this voice say? Two words: to live. No matter how loud the noise became, no
matter what a rumpus it made, or how long it carried on, it could never find those two
words. Those two little words weighed a ton, so they sank, and sank—all the way down, to
the very bottom; only immaterial things like smoke and mist could float up to the surface.
It was impossible to listen to this voice without crying. The prayers whispered in Peace
Lane went on day and night, like an ever-burning alter [sic] lamp, but they weren’t burning
on oil: inch by inch, they were burning thoughts. In contrast, the chaotic noises echoing in
the city’s air were nothing but the scraps and leftovers of life, which is why they could be so
liberally strewn about. The prayers concealed throughout those thousands of Shanghai
longtang rang out louder and clearer than all the church bells in Europe: they created a
rumbling thunder that seemed to emerge from the earth itself, the sound of mountains
crumbling. A shame we had no way of participating in this ourselves, but just looking at the
abyss they created was enough to make the heart grow cold. See what they have done to this
place! It is hard to say whether this was a form of construction or destruction, but whatever
it was, it was massive.
What Peace Lane prayed for was peace itself. You could hear it even from the bell that
was rung every night to warn people to mind their kitchen fires. Peace is not something
ordinary, but Peace Lane had an ordinary heart and its prayers were quite humble as well;
these modest requests, however, were not easily granted. No major disaster had befallen
Peace Lane in many years, but little things kept coming up, such as someone falling off the
balcony while bringing in their laundry, another getting electrocuted when he turned off a
light switch with a wet hand, pressure cooker explosions, rat poison accidentally ingested.
If all these, who died wrongful deaths, had cried out, their howls would have been deafening.
So how could one not pray for peace and security?
In the early evening, when the lights came on, you could see in all the windows the
watchful eyes of frightened people looking out for signs of trouble. But whenever something
bad did happen, no one ever saw it coming. This was where Peace Lane had gone numb
and where it displayed its pragmatism. The residents were never prepared for the closest
dangers. Yes, they understood the dangers of fire and electricity, but beyond that they had
no imagination. And so if you were to see the people of Peace Lane praying, they would be
like idiots reciting a book from memory, chanting with their lips but not their minds,
repeating the same incantations over and over again. Meanwhile the flowerpot
sitting on the windowsill was just an inch away from falling down, but no one ever bothered
to move it; the termites had already done their work on the floors, but no one ever seemed
to care; illegal structures kept being added one on top of the other, causing the foundation
to sink, yet another one was about to be built. During the typhoon season, when Peace Lane
shook and rattled and it appeared as if the entire neighborhood was going to pieces, people
curled up in their rooms, complacently enjoying the cool breeze brought by the storm.
What people in Peace Lane prayed for was to be able to live in a fool’s paradise—they would
rather turn a blind eye and never ask questions. The pigeon whistles sounding in the
morning sang of peace, announcing the good but never the bad; but even if they had, would
that have made a difference? You might be able to escape it in the first round, but would
you escape in the second? Put that way, those prayers must imply an acceptance, a sort of
Daoist resignation to reality. For want of anything else to pray for, night after night they
pray for peace, but that was just wishful thinking. ...
But now the story seems to be coming to an end. Even those who attempt brazen acts
with a smiling façade are met with sober, straight faces: the time for equivocation2 was over.
The tide was receding and the rocks would soon be exposed. Counting on one’s fingers, one
finds that the Shanghai longtang have quite a few years on them—a few more and they’ll
be treading on thin ice. Going up again to the highest point in the city and looking down,
one sees that the crisscrossing longtang neighborhoods are already beginning to look
desolate. If these had been large imposing building[s], that desolation might be mitigated
by their grand proportions. But longtang buildings all have low walls and narrow courtyards,
filled with ordinary people carrying out their mundane tasks: could places like these be
thought of as desolate? Desolation takes on a comical aspect in such places, and that only
makes the people living there all the more dejected. Putting it in harsher terms: the whole
place bore a certain resemblance to a heap of rubble. With the leaves falling in early
winter, all we see are broken bricks and shattered tiles. Like an aging beauty who retains
her alluring profile, it can no longer bear scrutiny. Should you insist on searching for a trace
of her former charm—after all, not everything is erased—you would have to look for it in
the turn of the alley. Left here, right there, as if glancing coquettishly3 from side to side, but
the eyes that are so flirtatious are also getting on in years, they have lost their luster and are
incapable of grabbing hold of your attention. Soon, sleet began to come down—that was the
frigid past accumulated over generations—turning to water before it even hit the ground. ...

...Brother, the business on which we are now come is to restore the friendship that has
existed between the United States and the Six Nations, agreeably to the direction of the
commissioner from the fifteen fires1 of the United States. He assured us that whensoever,
by any grievances, the chain of friendship should become rusty, we might have it brightened
by calling on you. We dispense with the usual formality of having your speech again read,
as we fully comprehended it yesterday, and it would therefore be useless to waste time in a
repetition of it.
Brother, yesterday you wiped the tears from our eyes, that we might see clearly; you
unstopped our ears that we might hear; and removed the obstructions from our throats that
we might speak distinctly. You offered to join with us in tearing up the largest pine-tree in
our forests, and under it to bury the tomahawk. We gladly join with you, brother, in this
work, and let us heap rocks and stones on the root of this tree that the tomahawk may never
again be found. ...
Brother, we observe that the men now in office are new men, and, we fear, not fully
informed of all that has befallen us. In 1791 a treaty was held by the commissioners of
Congress with us at Tioga Point, on a similar occasion. We have lost seven of our warriors,
murdered in cold blood by white men, since the conclusion of the war. We are tired of this
mighty grievance and wish some general arrangement to prevent it in future. The first of
these was murdered on the banks of the Ohio, near Fort Pitt. Shortly after two men
belonging to our first families were murdered at Pine Creek; then one at Fort Franklin;
another at Tioga Point; and now the two that occasion this visit, on the Big Beaver. These
last two had families. The one was a Seneca; the other a Tuscarora. Their families are now
destitute of support, and we think that the United States should do something toward their
support, as it is to the United States they owe the loss of their heads.
Brother, these offences are always committed in one place on the frontier of
Pennsylvania. In the Genesee country we live happy and no one molests us. I must
therefore beg that the President will exert all his influence with all officers, civil and
military, in that quarter, to remedy this grievance, and trust that he will thus prevent a
repetition of it and save our blood from being spilled in future.
Brother, let me call to mind the treaty between the United States and the Six Nations,
concluded at Canandaigua. At that treaty Colonel Pickering, who was commissioner on
behalf of the United States, agreed that the United States should pay to the Six Nations four
thousand five hundred dollars per annum, and that this should pass through the hands of
the superintendent of the United States, to be appointed for that purpose. This treaty was
made in the name of the President of the United States, who was then General Washington;
and, as he is now no more, perhaps the present President would wish to renew the treaty.
But if he should think the old one valid and is willing to let it remain in force we are also
willing. The sum above mentioned we wish to have part of in money, to expend in more
agricultural tools and in purchasing a team, as we have some horses that will do for the
purpose. We also wish to build a sawmill on the Buffalo creek. If the President, however,
thinks proper to have it continue as heretofore, we shall not be very uneasy. Whatever he
may do we agree to; we only suggest this for his consideration.
Brother, I hand you the above-mentioned treaty, made by Colonel Pickering, in the
name of General Washington, and the belt that accompanied it; as he is now dead we know
not if it is still valid. If not, we wish it renewed—if it is, we wish it copied on clean parchment.
Our money got loose in our trunk and tore it. We also show you the belt which is the path
of peace between our Six Nations and the United States. ...
Brother, the business that has caused this our long journey was occasioned by some of
your bad men; the expense of it has been heavy on us. We beg that as so great a breach has
been made on your part, the President will judge it proper that the United States should
bear our expenses to and from home and whilst here.
Brother, three horses belonging to the Tuscarora Nation were killed by some men under
the command of Major Rivardi, on the plains of Niagara. They have made application to the
superintendent and to Major Rivardi, but get no redress. You make us pay for our breaches
of the peace, why should you not pay also? A white man has told us the horses were killed
by Major Rivardi’s orders, who said they should not be permitted to come there, although
it was an open common on which they were killed. Mr. Chapin has the papers respecting
these horses, which we request you to take into consideration.}}

{{
Nine years ago Pyotr Sergeyitch, the deputy prosecutor, and I were riding towards
evening in haymaking time to fetch the letters from the station.
The weather was magnificent, but on our way back we heard a peal of thunder, and saw
an angry black storm-cloud which was coming straight towards us. The storm-cloud was
approaching us and we were approaching it. …
Then the first wave raced through the rye and a field of oats, there was a gust of wind,
and the dust flew round and round in the air. Pyotr Sergeyitch laughed and spurred on his horse.
“It’s fine!” he cried, “it’s splendid!”
Infected by his gaiety, I too began laughing at the thought that in a minute I should be
drenched to the skin and might be struck by lightning.
Riding swiftly in a hurricane when one is breathless with the wind, and feels like a bird,
thrills one and puts one’s heart in a flutter. By the time we rode into our courtyard the wind
had gone down, and big drops of rain were pattering on the grass and on the roofs. There
was not a soul near the stable. …
“What a crash!” said Pyotr Sergeyitch, coming up to me after a very loud rolling peal of
thunder when it seemed as though the sky were split in two. “What do you say to that?”
He stood beside me in the doorway and, still breathless from his rapid ride, looked at
me. I could see that he was admiring me.
“Natalya Vladimirovna,” he said, “I would give anything only to stay here a little longer
and look at you. You are lovely to-day.”
His eyes looked at me with delight and supplication,1 his face was pale. On his beard
and moustache were glittering raindrops, and they, too, seemed to be looking at me
with love.
“I love you,” he said. “I love you, and I am happy at seeing you. I know you cannot be
my wife, but I want nothing, I ask nothing; only know that I love you. Be silent, do not
answer me, take no notice of it, but only know that you are dear to me and let me look at
you.” …
“You say nothing, and that is splendid,” said Pyotr Sergeyitch. “Go on being silent.”
I felt happy. I laughed with delight and ran through the drenching rain to the house;
he laughed too, and, leaping as he went, ran after me.
Both drenched, panting, noisily clattering up the stairs like children, we dashed into the
room. My father and brother, who were not used to seeing me laughing and lighthearted,
looked at me in surprise and began laughing too. …
When I went to bed I lighted a candle and threw my window wide open, and an
undefined feeling took possession of my soul. I remembered that I was free and healthy,
that I had rank and wealth, that I was beloved; above all, that I had rank and wealth, rank
and wealth, my God! how nice that was!… Then, huddling up in bed at a touch of cold
which reached me from the garden with the dew, I tried to discover whether I loved Pyotr
Sergeyitch or not,… and fell asleep unable to reach any conclusion. …
And what happened afterwards? Why—nothing. In the winter when we lived in town
Pyotr Sergeyitch came to see us from time to time. Country acquaintances are charming
only in the country and in summer; in the town and in winter they lose their charm. When
you pour out tea for them in the town it seems as though they are wearing other people’s
coats, and as though they stirred their tea too long. In the town, too, Pyotr Sergeyitch spoke
sometimes of love, but the effect was not at all the same as in the country. In the town we
were more vividly conscious of the wall that stood between us: I had rank and wealth, while
he was poor, and he was not even a nobleman, but only the son of a deacon and a deputy
public prosecutor; we both of us—I through my youth and he for some unknown reason—
thought of that wall as very high and thick, and when he was with us in the town he would
criticize aristocratic society with a forced smile, and maintain a sullen silence when there
was anyone else in the drawing-room. There is no wall that cannot be broken through, but
the heroes of the modern romance, so far as I know them, are too timid, spiritless, lazy, and
oversensitive, and are too ready to resign themselves to the thought that they are doomed
to failure, that personal life has disappointed them; instead of struggling they merely
criticize, calling the world vulgar and forgetting that their criticism passes little by little into
vulgarity.
I was loved, happiness was not far away, and seemed to be almost touching me; I went
on living in careless ease without trying to understand myself, not knowing what I expected
or what I wanted from life, and time went on and on.… People passed by me with their
love, bright days and warm nights flashed by, the nightingales sang, the hay smelt fragrant,
and all this, sweet and overwhelming in remembrance, passed with me as with everyone
rapidly, leaving no trace, was not prized, and vanished like mist.… Where is it all?
My father is dead, I have grown older; everything that delighted me, caressed me, gave me
hope—the patter of the rain, the rolling of the thunder, thoughts of happiness, talk of
love—all that has become nothing but a memory, and I see before me a flat desert distance;
on the plain not one living soul, and out there on the horizon it is dark and terrible. …
A ring at the bell.… It is Pyotr Sergeyitch. When in the winter I see the trees and
remember how green they were for me in the summer I whisper:
“Oh, my darlings!”
And when I see people with whom I spent my spring-time, I feel sorrowful and warm
and whisper the same thing. …
Not knowing what to say I ask him:
“Well, what have you to tell me?”
“Nothing,” he answers. …
I thought of the past, and all at once my shoulders began quivering, my head dropped,
and I began weeping bitterly. I felt unbearably sorry for myself and for this man, and
passionately longed for what had passed away and what life refused us now. And now I did
not think about rank and wealth.
I broke into loud sobs, pressing my temples, and muttered:
“My God! my God! my life is wasted!”
And he sat and was silent, and did not say to me: “Don’t weep.” He understood that I
must weep, and that the time for this had come. …}}

{{A few years ago the City Council of Monza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping
goldfish in curved fishbowls. The sponsors of the measure explained that it is cruel to keep
a fish in a bowl because the curved sides give the fish a distorted view of reality. Aside from
the measure’s significance to the poor goldfish, the story raises an interesting philosophical
question: How do we know that the reality we perceive is true?
The goldfish is seeing a version of reality that is different from ours, but can we be sure
it is any less real? For all we know, we, too, may spend our entire lives staring out at the
world through a distorting lens.
In physics, the question is not academic. Indeed, physicists and cosmologists are
finding themselves in a similar predicament to the goldfish’s. For decades we have strived
to come up with an ultimate theory of everything—one complete and consistent set of
fundamental laws of nature that explain every aspect of reality. It now appears that this
quest may yield not a single theory but a family of interconnected theories, each describing
its own version of reality, as if it viewed the universe through its own fishbowl.
This notion may be difficult for many people, including some working scientists, to
accept. Most people believe that there is an objective reality out there and that our senses
and our science directly convey information about the material world. Classical science is
based on the belief that an external world exists whose properties are definite and inde-
pendent of the observer who perceives them. In philosophy, that belief is called realism. …
The idea of alternative realities is a mainstay of today’s popular culture. For example,
in the science-fiction film The Matrix the human race is unknowingly living in a simulated
virtual reality created by intelligent computers to keep them pacified and content while the
computers suck their bioelectrical energy (whatever that is). How do we know we are not
just computer-generated characters living in a Matrix-like world? If we lived in a synthetic,
imaginary world, events would not necessarily have any logic or consistency or obey any
laws. The aliens in control might find it more interesting or amusing to see our reactions,
for example, if everyone in the world suddenly decided that chocolate was repulsive or that
war was not an option, but that has never happened. If the aliens did enforce consistent
laws, we would have no way to tell that another reality stood behind the simulated one. It
is easy to call the world the aliens live in the “real” one and the computer-generated world
a false one. But if—like us—the beings in the simulated world could not gaze into their
universe from the outside, they would have no reason to doubt their own pictures of reality.
The goldfish are in a similar situation. Their view is not the same as ours from outside
their curved bowl, but they could still formulate scientific laws governing the motion of the
objects they observe on the outside. For instance, because light bends as it travels from air
to water, a freely moving object that we would observe to move in a straight line would be
observed by the goldfish to move along a curved path. The goldfish could formulate
scientific laws from their distorted frame of reference that would always hold true and that
would enable them to make predictions about the future motion of objects outside the
bowl. Their laws would be more complicated than the laws in our frame, but simplicity is a
matter of taste. If the goldfish formulated such a theory, we would have to admit the
goldfish’s view as a valid picture of reality. …
In the quest to discover the ultimate laws of physics, no approach has raised higher
hopes—or more controversy—than string theory. String theory was first proposed in the
1970s as an attempt to unify all the forces of nature into one coherent framework and, 
in particular, to bring the force of gravity into the domain of quantum1 physics. By the early
1990s, however, physicists discovered that string theory suffers from an awkward issue:
there are five different string theories. For those advocating that string theory was the
unique theory of everything, this was quite an embarrassment. In the mid-1990s
researchers started discovering that these different theories—and yet another theory called
supergravity—actually describe the same phenomena, giving them some hope that they
would amount eventually to a unified theory. The theories are indeed related by what
physicists call dualities, which are a kind of mathematical dictionaries for translating
concepts back and forth. But, alas, each theory is a good description of phenomena only
under a certain range of conditions—for example at low energies. None can describe every
aspect of the universe.
String theorists are now convinced that the five different string theories are just
different approximations to a more fundamental theory called M-theory. (No one seems to
know what the “M” stands for. It may be “master,” “miracle” or “mystery,” or all three.)
People are still trying to decipher the nature of M-theory, but it seems that the traditional
expectation of a single theory of nature may be untenable2 and that to describe the universe
we must employ different theories in different situations. Thus, M-theory is not a theory in
the usual sense but a network of theories. It is a bit like a map. To faithfully represent the
entire Earth on a flat surface, one has to use a collection of maps, each of which covers
a limited region. The maps overlap one another, and where they do, they show the same
landscape. Similarly, the different theories in the M-theory family may look very different,
but they can all be regarded as versions of the same underlying theory, and they all predict
the same phenomena where they overlap, but none works well in all situations.
Whenever we develop a model of the world and find it to be successful, we tend to
attribute to the model the quality of reality or absolute truth. But M-theory, like the
goldfish example, shows that the same physical situation can be modeled in different ways,
each employing different fundamental elements and concepts. It might be that to describe
the universe we have to employ different theories in different situations. Each theory may
have its own version of reality, but according to model-dependent realism, that diversity is
acceptable, and none of the versions can be said to be more real than any other. It is not the
physicist’s traditional expectation for a theory of nature, nor does it correspond to our
everyday idea of reality. But it might be the way of the universe.}}

{{It was generally agreed in New York that the Countess Olenska had “lost her looks.”
She had appeared there first, in Newland Archer’s boyhood, as a brilliantly pretty little
girl of nine or ten, of whom people said that she “ought to be painted.” Her parents had
been continental wanderers, and after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both, and
been taken in charge by her aunt, Medora Manson, also a wanderer, who was herself
returning to New York to “settle down.” …
Every one was disposed to be kind to little Ellen Mingott, though her dusky red cheeks
and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed unsuitable in a child who should still
have been in black for her parents. It was one of the misguided Medora’s many peculiarities
to flout the unalterable rules that regulated American mourning, and when she stepped
from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that the crape veil she wore for her
own brother was seven inches shorter than those of her sisters-in-law, while little Ellen was
in crimson merino and amber beads, like a gipsy foundling.1
But New York had so long resigned itself to Medora that only a few old ladies shook
their heads over Ellen’s gaudy clothes, while her other relations fell under the charm of
her high colour and high spirits. She was a fearless and familiar little thing, who asked
disconcerting questions, made precocious comments, and possessed outlandish arts, such as
dancing a Spanish shawl dance and singing Neapolitan love-songs to a guitar. Under the
direction of her aunt (whose real name was Mrs. Thorley Chivers, but who, having received
a Papal title,2 had resumed her first husband’s patronymic,3 and called herself the
Marchioness Manson, because in Italy she could turn it into Manzoni) the little girl received
an expensive but incoherent education, which included “drawing from the model,” a thing
never dreamed of before, and playing the piano in quintets with professional musicians. …
These things passed through Newland Archer’s mind a week later as he watched
the Countess Olenska enter the van der Luyden drawing-room on the evening of the
momentous dinner. The occasion was a solemn one, and he wondered a little nervously how
she would carry it off. She came rather late, one hand still ungloved, and fastening a
bracelet about her wrist; yet she entered without any appearance of haste or embarrassment
the drawing-room in which New York’s most chosen company was somewhat awfully
assembled.
In the middle of the room she paused, looking about her with a grave mouth and
smiling eyes; and in that instant Newland Archer rejected the general verdict on her looks.
It was true that her early radiance was gone. The red cheeks had paled; she was thin, worn,
a little older-looking than her age, which must have been nearly thirty. But there was about
her the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in the carriage of the head, the movement
of the eyes, which, without being in the least theatrical, struck him as highly trained and full
of a conscious power. At the same time she was simpler in manner than most of the ladies
present, and many people (as he heard afterward from Janey)4 were disappointed that
her appearance was not more “stylish” — for stylishness was what New York most valued.
It was, perhaps, Archer reflected, because her early vivacity5 had disappeared; because she
was so quiet—quiet in her movements, her voice, and the tones of her low-pitched voice.
New York had expected something a good deal more resonant in a young woman with such
a history.
The dinner was a somewhat formidable business. Dining with the van der Luydens was
at best no light matter, and dining there with a Duke who was their cousin was almost
a religious solemnity. It pleased Archer to think that only an old New Yorker could perceive
the shade of difference (to New York) between being merely a Duke and being the van der
Luydens’ Duke. New York took stray noblemen calmly, and even (except in the Struthers
set) with a certain distrustful hauteur; but when they presented such credentials as these
they were received with an old-fashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly
mistaken in ascribing solely to their standing in Debrett.7 It was for just such distinctions
that the young man cherished his old New York even while he smiled at it. …
The Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as Archer scanned
the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich
feathers, they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers. It frightened him to
think what must have gone to the making of her eyes.
The Duke of St. Austrey, who sat at his hostess’s right, was naturally the chief figure of
the evening. But if the Countess Olenska was less conspicuous than had been hoped, the
Duke was almost invisible. Being a well-bred man he had not (like another recent ducal8
visitor) come to the dinner in a shooting-jacket; but his evening clothes were so shabby and
baggy, and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun, that (with his stooping
way of sitting, and the vast beard spreading over his shirt-front) he hardly gave the
appearance of being in dinner attire. He was short, round-shouldered, sunburnt, with
a thick nose, small eyes and a sociable smile; but he seldom spoke, and when he did it was
in such low tones that, despite the frequent silences of expectation about the table,
his remarks were lost to all but his neighbours.
When the men joined the ladies after dinner the Duke went straight up to the Countess
Olenska, and they sat down in a corner and plunged into animated talk. Neither seemed
aware that the Duke should first have paid his respects to Mrs. Lovell Mingott and
Mrs. Headly Chivers, and the Countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac,
Mr. Urban Dagonet of Washington Square, who, in order to have the pleasure of meeting
her, had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out between January and April. The two
chatted together for nearly twenty minutes; then the Countess rose and, walking alone
across the wide drawing-room, sat down at Newland Archer’s side.
It was not the custom in New York drawing-rooms for a lady to get up and walk away
from one gentleman in order to seek the company of another. Etiquette required that
she should wait, immovable as an idol, while the men who wished to converse with her 
succeeded each other at her side. But the Countess was apparently unaware of having
broken any rule; she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside Archer, and looked at
him with the kindest eyes. …

arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those, who having
eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not the things which so nearly concern our temporal
salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it might cost, I am willing to know the
whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet
are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future,
but by the past; and, judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the
conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which
gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house? Is it that insidious2 smile
with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir, it will prove a snare
to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this
gracious reception of our petition, comports3 with those warlike preparations which cover
our waters and darken our land? Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and
reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force must be
called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements
of war and subjugation—the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen,
sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission?
Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this
quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has
none: they are meant for us: they can be meant for no other purpose—they are sent over to
bind and rivet upon us those chains, which the British ministry have been so long forging.
And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that
for the last ten years. Have we any thing new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have
held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we
resort to entreaty and humble supplication?5 What terms shall we find, which have not been
already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have
done every thing that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have
petitioned—we have remonstrated6 we have supplicated—we have prostrated7 ourselves
before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of
the ministry and parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have
produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we
have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne.
In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.
There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean to preserve
inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending—if we
mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and
which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon, until the glorious object of our contest
shall be obtained—we must fight!—I repeat it, sir, we must fight—An appeal to arms and
to the God of Hosts, is all that is left us!
They tell us, sir, that we are weak—unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.
But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when
we are totally disarmed; and when a British guard shall be stationed in our House? Shall
we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual
resistance, by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope,
until our enemies shall have bound us, hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make
a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power—three
millions of people, armed in the holy cause of Liberty, and in such a country as that which
we possess; are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.
Sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God, who presides over the
destinies of nations, and will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not
to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have now no
election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.
There is no retreat, but in submission and slavery. Our chains are forged:—their clanking
may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable—and let it come!! I repeat it,
sir, let it come!!!
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace—but there
is no peace! The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north, will bring
to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand
we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or
peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains, and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty
God!—I know not what course others may take; but as for me, GIVE ME LIBERTY, OR
GIVE ME DEATH!

{{…I assured his honor that law was a science, in which I had not much conversed,
further than by employing advocates in vain, upon some injustice that had been done me:
however, I would give him all the satisfaction I was able.
I said there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in the art of
proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is black, and black is white,
according as they are paid. To this society all the rest of the people are slaves. For example,
if my neighbor has a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow
from me. I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against all rules of law that
any man should be allowed to speak for himself. “Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner,
lie under two great disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practiced almost from his cradle
in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an advocate for
justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts with great awkwardness, if not with
ill-will. The second disadvantage is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else
he will be reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that would
lessen the practice of the law. And therefore I have but two methods to preserve my cow.
The first is, to gain over my adversary’s lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray
his client by insinuating that he has justice on his side. The second way is for my lawyer
to make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong to my adversary;
and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly bespeak the favor of the bench. Now your
honor is to know that these judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of
property as well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most dexterous
lawyers, who have grown old or lazy; and having been biased all their lives against truth and
equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of favoring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have
known some of them refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure
the faculty by doing anything unbecoming their nature or their office.
“It is a maxim among these lawyers, that whatever has been done before may legally be
done again; and therefore they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made
against common justice and the general reason of mankind. These, under the name of
precedents, they produce as authorities to justify the most iniquitous1 opinions; and the
judges never fail of directing accordingly.
“In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the cause; but are loud,
violent, and tedious in dwelling upon all circumstances which are not to the purpose. For
instance, in the case already mentioned, they never desire to know what claim or title my
adversary has to my cow, but whether the said cow were red or black, her horns long or
short; whether the field I graze her in be round or square; whether she was milked at home
or abroad; what diseases she is subject to, and the like; after which they consult precedents,
adjourn the case from time to time, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years come to an issue.
“It is likewise to be observed that this society has a peculiar cant and jargon2 of their
own that no other mortal can understand, and wherein all their laws are written, which they
take special care to multiply; whereby they have wholly confounded3 the very essence
of truth and falsehood, of right and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to decide whether
the field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me or to a stranger
three hundred miles off.
“In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the method is much more
short and commendable: the judge first sends to sound the disposition4 of those in power,
after which he can easily hang or save a criminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.”
Here my master, interposing, said it was a pity that creatures endowed with such
prodigious5 abilities of mind as these lawyers, by the description I gave of them, must
certainly be, were not rather encouraged to be instructors of others in wisdom and
knowledge. In answer to which I assured his honor that in all points out of their own trade
they were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us; the most despicable
in common conversation, avowed enemies to all knowledge and learning, and equally
disposed to pervert the general reason of mankind in every other subject of discourse as in
that of their own profession. }}

##August 2015##

{{The morning chill carried that clean-sheet crispness; that cleansing sort of air. Actually,
for the tip of Long Island in early December, this weather was a little late in coming. But
walking from our house to the shore of the bay, the new crystal air made me finally look
ahead toward winter and turn my back to what had been a spectacular, lingering fall.
Every autumn here witnesses two great migrations: one axiomatic and one nearly
unknown. Everybody knows birds fly south for the winter. Here, the marshes and barrier
islands are interstate arteries for heavy traffic of songbirds, waterfowl, hawks and others.
But except for people who fish, almost no one realizes the greater migration begins just
beyond the beach.
This year, as usual, swarms of fish had arrived from New England in the last few weeks
and departed down the coast in great migrating waves. They included millions and millions
of anchovies and menhaden, pursued to the surface by armies of bluefish, striped bass,
little tuna. Along the seafloor battalions of summer flounder, black sea bass, tautog, porgies
and others moved to deeper grounds. Offshore, beyond sight of land on the rolling blue
prairies of the sea, sharks and tunas passed like herds on the Serengeti (though now, like
those herds, much diminished). Herring and mackerel had arrived mid-November with
dolphins on their tails, and the remaining schools of striped bass, fattening for their long run
to winter grounds, gobbled them greedily. Even now, into December, a few boats were still
hunting bass. But we had caught enough, our freezer was stocked for winter and our smoker
racks were busy, and we’d just hauled the boat.
Patricia and I put our footsteps to the gravelly beach and walked to the inlet to see
who’d recently arrived. Bonaparte’s gulls, a few long-tailed ducks, some black scoters and in
the distance the feathered missiles called gannets were sending geysers skyward as a flock
poured into a herring school. To me, this seasonal sense of place in the path of migrations,
this finger on the pulse of the planet, is the purest joy.
We were just rounding the inlet entrance when, among the shells and tide-wrack, my gaze
caught something so unexpected — here, and in this near-frost — it seemed improbable as
a fallen angel: a sea turtle.
It was a baby, with a platter-sized shell. Species: Kemp’s ridley, most endangered of all
Atlantic turtles. Stunned by the boreal air and 49-degree water, the turtle’s only sign of life
was a mark in the wet sand suggesting a flipper had moved sometime since high tide had
left it and withdrawn.
This nation that sees itself stretching from sea to shining sea conceals beneath her
broad, waving skirts of bordering oceans some of the greatest wildlife in the world. And
because it’s so effectively hidden, it’s some of the least understood.
Though the saltiness of our blood and tears speaks from within of our parent ocean, for
most people oceans seem distant, out of sight and generally out of mind. Even many who
love nature, who see our landscape and imagine herds of bison and skies darkened by
passenger pigeons and clouds of waterfowl, who escape into the woods or mountains or
even the shore, seem to get their vision stranded on the beach as though wildlife stops at
the high-tide line, where our little stunned turtle reminded us that so much actually begins.
The water makes a perfect disguise that heightens the mystery, but in some ways that’s
a great pity, because the closest thing we have left to the thundering herds and great flocks
is in the sea. Extending your vision into the grand swirl and suck of the many-fingered tides
and beyond will grant you a renewed sense of both the abundance and fragility of life.
Whether or not we can see, hear, or feel the ocean from our own home territory,
the ocean certainly feels all of us. Between a third and half the world’s people now live
within 50 miles of a coast (as any traveler can attest). In China, population density is three
times higher in coastal areas than elsewhere. The collective weight of humanity may rest on
land, but we levy heavy pressure on the sea. Most of us exert our most direct interaction
with the sea through the seafood we buy. But even air quality affects water quality because
what goes up alights elsewhere, and climate change is challenging ocean habitats by melting
sea ice and cooking corals, undermining food supplies for penguins, polar bears and reef
fishes.
People who think of themselves as conservationists carry a concern for wildlife, wildlands
and habitat quality as part of their sense of right and wrong. It is time to take these concerns
below high tide. Most people would not question a hawk’s place in the sky, nor ask what
good is a gazelle, nor wonder whether the world really needs wild orchids. Yet when told of
the plight of, say, sharks, many still think it quite reasonable to inquire, “What good are they;
why do we need them?” Fifty million buffalo once roamed the rolling green prairies of
North America. Gunners reduced them to near-extinction. Now, hunters cut from the same
cloth are at work on the rolling blue prairies of the sea and, already, the big fish — including
miracles like thousand-pound, warm-blooded bluefin tuna — are 90 percent gone. What we
regret happening on land may again happen in the sea. Those who care about wildlife
should get to know about oceans.
We brought the turtle home and warmed it a bit in the sun. It began to shed tears, a sign
of ongoing glandular function and, for us, heightened hope. Soon a flipper waved — a certain
signal of persistent life. Shortly thereafter, the aquarium people arrived to bring our little
patient into veterinary rehab. Slowly warmed, within a few hours it was conscious and
swimming, safe until release next spring.
Whether we help one unlucky creature or wish to save the world, for each of us the
challenge and opportunity is to cherish all life as the gift it is, envision it whole, seek to know
it truly, and undertake — with our minds, hearts and hands — to restore its abundance.
Where there’s life there’s hope, and so no place can inspire more hopefulness than
the great, life-making sea, home to creatures of mystery and majesty, whose future now
depends on human compassion, and our next move.}}

{{The factory made the best centrifugal pumps in the world, and Merle Waggoner owned
it. He’d started it. He’d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and
Foundry Company. He didn’t have any stockholders and he didn’t owe a dime. He was
fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir—a son. The boy’s name was Franklin. The boy
was named after Benjamin Franklin.
One Friday afternoon father and son came out of Merle’s office and into the factory.
They went down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg’s lathe.
“Rudy,” said Merle, “the boy here’s home from college for three days, and I thought
maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay
pigeons tomorrow.”
Rudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle’s age, and
he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early—who
had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute and his
shotgun. …
“Let’s go ask my boy what he’s got on tomorrow,” said Rudy. It was a formality. Karl
always did what his father wanted him to do—did it with profound love. …
Karl was a carbon copy of his father. He was such a good mimic of Rudy that his joints
seemed to ache a little with age. He seemed sobered by fifty-one years of life, though he’d
lived only twenty. He seemed instinctively wary of safety hazards that had been eliminated
from the factory by the time he’d learned to walk. Karl stood at attention without humility,
just as his father had done.
“Want to go shooting tomorrow?” said Rudy.
“Shoot what?” said Karl.
“Crows. Clay pigeons,” said Rudy. “Maybe a woodchuck.”
“Don’t mind,” said Karl. He nodded briefly to Merle and Franklin. “Glad to.” …
Rudy nodded. He examined the work in Karl’s lathe and tapped his own temple. The
tapping was a signal that Franklin had seen many times on hunts. It meant that Karl was
doing fine.
Rudy touched Karl’s elbow lightly. It was the signal for Karl to get back to work. Rudy
and Karl each held up a crooked finger and saluted with it. Franklin knew what that meant
too. It meant, “Good-by, I love you.” …
Merle was sitting at his desk, his head down, when Franklin came in. He held a steel
plate about six inches square in his left hand. In the middle of the plate was a hole two inches
square. In his right hand he held a steel cube that fitted the hole exactly. …
Franklin sat down gingerly on a hard chair by the wall. The office hadn’t changed much
in the years he’d known it. It was one more factory room, with naked pipes overhead—the
cold ones sweaty, the hot ones dry. Wires snaked from steel box to steel box. The green walls
and cream trim were as rough as elephant hide in some places, with alternating coats of
paint and grime, paint and grime.
There had never been time to scrape away the layers, and barely enough time,
overnight, to slap on new paint. And there had never been time in which to finish the rough
shelves that lined the room. …
Merle slipped the cube through the square hole once more. “Know what these are?” he
said.
“Yes, sir,” said Franklin. “They’re what Rudy Linberg had to make when he was an
apprentice in Sweden.”
The cube could be slipped through the hole in twenty-four different ways, without
letting the tiniest ray of light pass through with it.
“Unbelievable skill,” said Franklin respectfully. “There aren’t craftsmen like that
coming along any more.” He didn’t really feel much respect. He was simply saying what he
knew his father wanted to hear. The cube and the hole struck him as criminal wastes of time
and great bores. “Unbelievable,” he said again.
“It’s utterly unbelievable, when you realize that Rudy didn’t make them,” said Merle
gravely, “when you realize what generation the man who made them belongs to.”
“Oh?” said Franklin. “Who did make them?”
“Rudy’s boy, Karl,” said Merle. “A member of your generation.” He ground out his cigar
sadly. “He gave them to me on my last birthday. They were on my desk, boy, waiting for me
when I came in—right beside the ones Rudy gave me thirty-one years before.” …
“I could have cried, boy, when I saw those two plates and those two cubes side by side,”
said Merle. “Can you understand that?” he asked beseechingly. “Can you understand why
I’d feel like crying?” …
“The cube of Karl’s fitted through the hole of Rudy’s!” said Merle. “They were
interchangeable!”
“Gosh!” said Franklin. “I’ll be darned. Really?”
And now he felt like crying, because he didn’t care, couldn’t care—and would have
given his right arm to care. The factory whanged and banged and screeched in monstrous
irrelevance—Franklin’s, all Franklin’s, if he just said the word.
“What’ll you do with it—buy a theater in New York?” said Merle abruptly.
“Do with what, sir?” said Franklin.
“The money I’ll get for the factory when I sell it—the money I’ll leave to you when I’m
dead,” said Merle. He hit the word “dead” hard. “What’s Waggoner Pump going to be
converted into? Waggoner Theaters? Waggoner School of Acting? The Waggoner Home for
Broken-Down Actors?”
“I—I hadn’t thought about it,” said Franklin. The idea of converting Waggoner Pump
into something equally complicated hadn’t occurred to him, and appalled him now. He was
being asked to match his father’s passion for the factory with an equal passion for something
else. And Franklin had no such passion—for the theater or anything else. …
“Don’t sell on my account,” said Franklin wretchedly.
“On whose account would I keep it?” said Merle.
“Do you have to sell it today?” said Franklin, horrified.
“Strike while the iron’s hot, I always say,” said Merle. “Today’s the day you decided to
be an actor, and, as luck would have it, we have an excellent offer for what I did with my
life.”
“Couldn’t we wait?”
“For what?” said Merle. He was having a good time now.
“Father!” cried Franklin. “For the love of heaven, father, please!” He hung his head and
shook it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said brokenly. “I don’t know for sure what I want
to do yet. I’m just playing with ideas, trying to find myself. Please, father, don’t sell what
you’ve done with your life, don’t just throw it away because I’m not sure I want to do that
with my life too! Please!” Franklin looked up. “I’m not Karl Linberg,” he said. “I can’t help
it. I’m sorry, but I’m not Karl Linberg.” …}}

We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps
can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are
such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a
military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? …
No doubt in an H-bomb1 war great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the
minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and
Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from
the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test,2 that nuclear bombs can
gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed. …
Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in
military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say
is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We
have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon
their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon
the extent of the particular expert’s knowledge. We have found that the men who know most
are the most gloomy.
Here, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable:
Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face
this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.
The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But
what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the
term “mankind” feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the
danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly
apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually,
and those whom they love are in imminent3 danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they
hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are
prohibited.
This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in
time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides
would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side
manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would
inevitably be victorious.
Although an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of
armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes.
First: any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish
tension. Second: the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the
other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of
Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We
should, therefore, welcome such an agreement, though only as a first step.
Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that,
if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any
possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or
European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by
war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.
There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and
wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We
appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you
the risk of universal death.
Resolution: We invite this Congress,4 and through it the scientists of the world and the general
public, to subscribe to the following resolution:
“In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be
employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge
the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their
purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find
peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.”}}

{{…When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners.
When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was
the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble
lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in
the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind
the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes1 from the cottages, to the back
doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark
odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from
the buckled harness. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had
filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had
seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother
in to his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to
see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked
up to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from
the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the
railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair
tossed from side to side.
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was
pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out
on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept
her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning.
I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood. …
At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused
that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forget whether
I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar,2 she said she would love to go.
‘And why can’t you?’ I asked.
While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not
go, she said, because there would be a retreat3 that week in her convent.4 Her brother and
two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of
the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught
the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand
upon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat,
just visible as she stood at ease.
‘It’s well for you,’ she said.
‘If I go,’ I said, ‘I will bring you something.’
What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that
evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of
school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me
and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through
the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked
for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised and hoped it was not
some Freemason5 affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master’s face pass
from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my
wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which,
now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child’s play, ugly monotonous
child’s play.
On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the
evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:
‘Yes, boy, I know.’ …
At nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him talking to
himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat.
I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give
me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.
‘The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,’ he said.
I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically: ‘Can’t you give him the money and
let him go? You’ve kept him late enough as it is.’…
I held a florin6 tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the
station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me
the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After
an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among
ruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people
pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special
train for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew
up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the
lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building
which displayed the magical name. …
Remembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the stalls and
examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was
talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English accents and
listened vaguely to their conversation. …
Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything.
The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense
of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the
dark entrance to the stall and murmured:
‘No, thank you.’
The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young
men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me
over her shoulder.
I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in
her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of
the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a
voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was
now completely dark.
Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and
my eyes burned with anguish and anger.

…Memory teaches me what I know of these matters. The boy reminds the adult. I was
a bilingual child, but of a certain kind: “socially disadvantaged,” the son of working-class
parents, both Mexican immigrants. …
In public, my father and mother spoke a hesitant, accented, and not always grammatical
English. And then they would have to strain, their bodies tense, to catch the sense of what
was rapidly said by los gringos. At home, they returned to Spanish. The language of their
Mexican past sounded in counterpoint to the English spoken in public. The words would
come quickly, with ease. Conveyed through those sounds was the pleasing, soothing,
consoling reminder that one was at home.
During those years when I was first learning to speak, my mother and father addressed
me only in Spanish; in Spanish I learned to reply. By contrast, English (inglés) was the
language I came to associate with gringos, rarely heard in the house. I learned my first
words of English overhearing my parents speaking to strangers. At six years of age, I knew
just enough words for my mother to trust me on errands to stores one block away—but no
more.
I was then a listening child, careful to hear the very different sounds of Spanish and
English. Wide-eyed with hearing, I’d listen to sounds more than to words. First, there were
English (gringo) sounds. So many words still were unknown to me that when the butcher
or the lady at the drugstore said something, exotic polysyllabic sounds would bloom in the
midst of their sentences. Often the speech of people in public seemed to me very loud,
booming with confidence. The man behind the counter would literally ask, “What can I do
for you?” But by being so firm and clear, the sound of his voice said that he was a gringo;
he belonged in public society. There were also the high, nasal notes of middle-class
American speech—which I rarely am conscious of hearing today because I hear them so
often, but could not stop hearing when I was a boy. Crowds at Safeway or at bus stops were
noisy with the birdlike sounds of los gringos. I’d move away from them all—all the chirping
chatter above me.
My own sounds I was unable to hear, but I knew that I spoke English poorly. My words
could not extend to form complete thoughts. And the words I did speak I didn’t know well
enough to make distinct sounds. (Listeners would usually lower their heads to hear better
what I was trying to say). But it was one thing for me to speak English with difficulty; it was
more troubling to hear my parents speaking in public: their high-whining vowels and
guttural1 consonants; their sentences that got stuck with “eh” and “ah” sounds; the confused
syntax; the hesitant rhythm of sounds so different from the way gringos spoke. I’d notice,
moreover, that my parents’ voices were softer than those of gringos we would meet.
I am tempted to say now that none of this mattered. (In adulthood I am embarrassed
by childhood fears.) And, in a way, it didn’t matter very much that my parents could not
speak English with ease. Their linguistic difficulties had no serious consequences.
My mother and father made themselves understood at the county hospital clinic and at
government offices. And yet, in another way, it mattered very much. It was unsettling to
hear my parents struggle with English. Hearing them, I’d grow nervous, and my clutching
trust in their protection and power would be weakened. …
But then there was Spanish: español, the language rarely heard away from the house;
español, the language which seemed to me therefore a private language, my family’s
language. To hear its sounds was to feel myself specially recognized as one of the family,
apart from los otros. A simple remark, an inconsequential comment could convey that
assurance. My parents would say something to me and I would feel embraced by the sounds
of their words. Those sounds said: I am speaking with ease in Spanish. I am addressing you
in words I never use with los gringos. I recognize you as someone special, close, like no one
outside. You belong with us. In the family. Ricardo.
At the age of six, well past the time when most middle-class children no longer notice
the difference between sounds uttered at home and words spoken in public, I had a
different experience. I lived in a world compounded of sounds. I was a child longer than
most. I lived in a magical world, surrounded by sounds both pleasing and fearful. I shared
with my family a language enchantingly private—different from that used in the city around
us. …
If I rehearse here the changes in my private life after my Americanization, it is finally
to emphasize a public gain. The loss implies the gain. The house I returned to each
afternoon was quiet. Intimate sounds no longer greeted me at the door. Inside there were
other noises. The telephone rang. Neighborhood kids ran past the door of the bedroom
where I was reading my schoolbooks—covered with brown shopping-bag paper. Once
I learned the public language, it would never again be easy for me to hear intimate family
voices. More and more of my day was spent hearing words, not sounds. But that may only
be a way of saying that on the day I raised my hand in class and spoke loudly to an entire
roomful of faces, my childhood started to end. …}}
