Reading Comprehension Passage A
On the day that gold was discovered near his village, Mohammed Muda Nor had
worked all morning tapping rubber.1 At one o’clock he walked out from the airy rows of
trees, waved to Abdullah, the entry guard, who was already eating his lunch, and started
down the dusty road home. The call to prayer wavered from the village mosque, and it
seemed to Muda that he could see it, waves of sound shimmering concurrently with the
midday heat. It was the end of the fruit season, one of the last hot weeks before the rains
began, and the weather was a fiery hand against his back. Muda walked with his straw hat
pulled down low over his forehead, so he didn’t see the children running toward him until
they were quite near. They circled around him and pulled in close, like the petals on a closing
flower.
“Pachik Muda.” It was his oldest nephew, a boy named Amin. He was wearing shorts
and holding the hand of his youngest sister, Maimunah, who stood brown and naked beside
him. “Uncle, our mother says for you to come quickly to the river.” …
“Tell your mother,” he said, “that I will come later. Right now I am going for my lunch.”
He expected them to run off then. They were the children of his sister, Norliza, and they
were rarely naughty. But instead Amin released his sister’s hand. He reached out and
tugged at Muda’s sarong.2
“My mother says to come,” he repeated. “Please, Pachik Muda, she says it is important.”
Muda sighed then, but he turned and followed the children back along the road. Red
rambutans3 and smooth green mangoes hung from the trees. He plucked some of these and
ate them as he walked, wondering what he would find on the riverbank. Norliza had worked
the rubber too, before she married, and she would not take him lightly from his rest and
prayers.
When he reached the river he saw a cluster of women standing on the grassy bank.
Norliza was in the center, her sarong wet to the knees, holding something out for the
others to see.
“Norliza,” he called. He was going to scold her for consuming his time with her bit of
woman’s nonsense, but before he could speak she ran to him and uncurled her fist. The
lines in her palm were creased with dirt, so that the skin around them looked very pale. The
words he had planned stopped in his mouth. For on her palm lay a piece of gold as large as
a knuckle. It was wet with river water, and it caught the noon light like fire in her hand.
“The children found it,” she said. “I was digging for roots.” Norliza was a midwife,
known in the village for her skill with herbs and massage. She came into the jungle every
week to search for the healing roots and bark. “I was digging there, near the trees by the
river. The children were playing next to me, sorting out the rocks for a game. This one they
liked because of its shine. At first I did not realize. It was only when Amin washed it in the
river that I understood.” Her dark eyes gleamed with an unfamiliar excitement. “To think,”
she said. “To think he might have dropped it, and I would never have known.”

Muda reached out and took the knot of gold. It was smooth, almost soft, against his
fingers. He ran his thumb against it again and again. Some of the women drew close to
stare. Others, he noticed, were already moving away with the news. …

Reading Comprehension Passage B
Norman Rockwell didn’t create his celebrated images using only brush and paint. They
often took shape first as scenes that Rockwell literally acted out, not only for his editors at
the [Saturday Evening] Post, but his real-life models, too. “It was strenuous,” he once
explained, “but I felt it was the best way to get across my meaning.” And so he would
enthusiastically play out his visions and ideas, a one-man show packed with just the right
expressions, giving enough details of each persona in the scene to inspire his models and,
more importantly, get his editors to buy his ideas.
Now, more than 30 years after his death, Rockwell is still acknowledged for deftly1
chronicling the best of 20th century American life with vignettes2 of simple emotions
evoked by everyday people. This phenomenon is a resounding testament to Rockwell’s
prowess as a storyteller and is the subject of another kind of one-man show: the upcoming
exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., titled Telling
Stories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The
exhibit, assembled from the private collections of these two popular film directors, will
feature rarely viewed pieces of Rockwell’s work, including George Lucas’ favorite, Lands of
Enchantment, which shows a youngster imagining himself as an armor-clad knight riding
away with a beautiful girl. The point is not the boy reading, but how the book inspires the
boy’s imagination, taking him, in idealized form, to another time and place. …
“Storytelling was very important to Norman Rockwell,” says Lucas. “Every image has
either the middle or the end of a story, and you can already see the beginning even though
it’s not there. You can see all the missing parts of the story because he took that one frame
that sort of tells you everything you need to know.
“And, of course, in filmmaking we strive for that. We strive to get images that convey,
visually, a lot of information without having to spend a lot of time at it. Norman Rockwell
was a master at that—he was a master at telling a story in one frame,” explains Lucas.
That concentration of information as well as emotion is something inherent3 in
Rockwell’s art. Emotion certainly spoke to Steven Spielberg when he first saw one of his
favorite Rockwell paintings, High Dive, the August 16, 1947 Post cover that depicts a boy
at the top of what must be (or so we imagine from the boy’s expression) a towering diving
board. He crouches high above a swimming pool, too afraid to either jump or climb back
down. The painting hangs in Spielberg’s office at Amblin Entertainment because it holds a
great deal of meaning for the filmmaker. …
Even in the creation of their work, Spielberg and Rockwell were more similar than is
immediately evident. To create his meticulously detailed recollections of everyday
American life, Rockwell worked much like a film director, not just acting out the scenes in his
imagination, but scouting locations, casting everyday people from his town for particular
parts, choosing costumes and props, and directing his performers to make them instantly
familiar to the public. Little wonder then, that filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, as well
as others, should be so inspired by his work.
In directing his own scenes, Rockwell had a specific focus, just not one based on the
stark realism in which he grew up. Instead, Rockwell aimed to depict life in a kind of
realistic fantasy. He later remarked in his autobiography, My Adventures as an Illustrator,
“I paint the world not as it is, but as I would like it to be.” …

Passage I
The House by the Side of the Road
There are hermit souls that live withdrawn
In the peace of their self-content;
There are souls, like stars, that dwell apart,
In a fellowless firmament;1
There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths
Where highways never ran;—
But let me live by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.
Let me live in a house by the side of the road,
Where the race of men go by—
The men who are good and the men who are bad,
As good and as bad as I.
I would not sit in the scorner’s seat,
Or hurl the cynic’s ban;—
Let me live in a house by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.
I see from my house by the side of the road,
By the side of the highway of life,
The men who press with the ardor2 of hope,
The men who are faint with the strife.
But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears—
Both parts of an infinite plan;—
Let me live in my house by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.
I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead
And mountains of wearisome height;
That the road passes on through the long afternoon
And stretches away to the night.
But still I rejoice when the travellers rejoice,
And weep with the strangers that moan,
Nor live in my house by the side of the road
Like a man who dwells alone.

Where the race of men go by—

Wise, foolish—so am I.

Or hurl the cynic’s ban?—
Let me live in my house by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.

Passage II
There was no sign of the whale’s mother by the jetty,1 underwater, or anywhere else so
I started swimming back toward the pier, hoping the baby whale would follow. He didn’t.
I thought that if I could communicate with him he would come with me, like a dog
responding to a familiar whistle. I thought that maybe if I could try to speak in his language
he would understand. I tried to repeat his chirp. It was pathetic. It didn’t sound anything
like him. I tried to grunt, a really big grunt, but all I got was a noseful of saltwater and tears
in my goggles from the salty sting. I returned to the surface to clear the water out of my
nose. …
But the baby whale had already turned and started to head offshore. He looked over at
me as if to say, Please come swim with me.
I knew it made no sense to follow him. I could think of many reasons why I couldn’t or
shouldn’t, but I didn’t want him to go off alone. ...
I swam with Grayson [the whale] one hundred yards off the pier, two hundred yards,
three hundred, four hundred, and on a breath, I looked back over my right shoulder. The
pier and the people on it were becoming smaller and smaller. We continued swimming near
each other. Grayson led the way. He swam directly toward the oil rig and I followed in his
wake. A couple of times he slowed down and stopped dead in the water. He seemed
restless and sort of agitated. He probably hadn’t eaten for at least a few hours. His energy
level had to be dropping.
“Come on, Grayson. Let’s swim out there and see if we can find your mother,” I said,
encouraging him, knowing he couldn’t understand a single word, but hoping he would
somehow understand the thought. ...
Grayson was swimming hard against the resistance of the waves. He was breathing
more rapidly, his poofing sounds were more frequent. He seemed to be very stressed. …
His poor mother, though, had to be frantically searching for him. How in this big ocean
would she ever find him?
Do what you can do, I thought, don’t get overwhelmed by the enormity of something.
Break it down into smaller pieces like you do when you swim. Do one thing at a time.
“Grayson, let’s swim back to shore now,” I said. I had to. I was cold. And tired and
depleted. My eyes were burning from the saltwater leaking into my goggles.
Grayson seemed to understand. He turned with me and started swimming toward shore.
The current seemed to rise on our backs as if a giant hand was lifting us and carrying us
toward shore. I felt a deep sense of relief. I was ready to reach the beach.
But all of a sudden, Grayson dramatically changed course.
He turned almost completely around. Had he heard his mother’s voice?
